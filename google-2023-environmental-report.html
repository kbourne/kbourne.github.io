A letter from our Senior Vice President 
of Learning and Sustainability
I was introduced to the problem of climate change in the late 
1980s through a prescient class I took as an undergraduate. The models were less sophisticated and more uncertain than they are today, but the implications were already worrying. Thirty years later much has changed. The threat is now more immediate, but the world is also taking action—from governmental policy and technology innovation to actions by individuals and organizations—driven by a broader awareness of the danger.
I worked on Search for 20 years, leading the product for 
many of those, and learned a lot about the unique impact Google can have on the world. I’ve always been proud of Google’s leadership in pushing the boundaries of sustainability in our data centers, including achieving carbon neutrality in 2007 (at the time, such accomplishments were uncommon). Going further, we’ve matched 100% of our global electricity use with renewable energy purchases for the last six years—a goal that seemed almost crazy when we set it in 2012. 
Today our ambitions have evolved—we now have a bold 
goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain, and as part of that goal, to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate. The path to get to these goals is difficult, and we’re committed to working through the challenges we face with the ultimate aim of driving larger systems change to create a more sustainable future. Further, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is difficult. Despite this, we remain focused on developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient while leveraging the opportunities that AI presents to have a positive environmental impact. 
Beyond our own footprint, Google’s founding mission—
“Organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”—can play a very important role in accelerating progress in climate information and action. A sustainable future will be built upon billions of decisions made by governments, organizations, and individuals, which will need to be grounded in good information. Increasingly, we see through Google Trends that more and more people are looking for ways to live sustainably. I believe that we have many strengths and capabilities in providing quality information that people are seeking to make decisions that’ll drive positive action for our planet.
Helpful information  can be critical in both efforts to reduce 
emissions as well as adapt to extreme climate events like 
floods, wildfires, and heat waves. But this information often lives in silos and is hard to access. Making the information accessible and useful can be a tough technical challenge. Our products like Environmental Insights Explorer, Earth Engine, and Data Commons are key solutions to support the decisions that cities and organizations will have to make. Information can also have a significant impact on the decisions of individuals—particularly in the areas of home energy and transportation. Our products like Maps, Search, and Nest reach billions of users around the world, and we’re building many features to respond to the demand for that information in our products. 
Given the scale of the problem, innovation  will also be 
key to getting us to a better future. In order to push the 
frontiers of innovation, Google has long had a world-class research organization that’s been at the forefront of AI and machine learning. These solutions can help in predicting 
more extreme weather (flood forecasting, for instance), optimizing systems from traffic lights to car routes, and mitigating climate change in new ways, for example. 
In our 2023 Environmental Report, we’re highlighting how 
these themes of information and innovation run through much of our work:
For information, we’ll feature Google Trends  
insights alongside key initiatives to show how our work is informed by societal trends and expectations.
And for innovation, we’ll call out the many  
places where AI is helping to break down  barriers and advance our work.
Over my tenure at Google, I’ve seen how we’ve been working to integrate sustainability into our work. This transition is going to be challenging—both for us and for the world at large—and there’s no playbook for making it happen. But we see our efforts as part of a bigger picture, setting our goals to help scale global solutions, and I’m optimistic that we can, through our efforts in both information and innovation, play a helpful role in building a more sustainable and resilient future.

A letter from our  
Chief Sustainability Officer
I grew up in Muir Beach, California, and was fortunate 
to spend my childhood exploring its beautiful redwood forests and vibrant tidepools with my family. Today, I’m raising my daughter in these same special places, but now these delicate ecosystems are threatened, just like many other parts of the world. 
Climate change affects all aspects of society, from food 
production and human health to infrastructure and the economy. These impacts are interconnected and can have a cascading effect on people and the planet. The response calls for systemic, global action to reduce emissions, improve watershed health, maximize the reuse of finite resources, and protect biodiversity.
Since Google was founded, our efforts to mitigate climate 
change have started with our own operations, and we’ve worked hard to lead by example with the ultimate goal of driving larger systemic change. In our third decade of climate action, we’ll continue to take a science-based approach to our efforts, while sharing our own lessons and progress with others. 
I joined Google eight years ago to lead our sustainability 
efforts, and have witnessed our sense of urgency and ambition firsthand. We’re empowering individuals, governments, businesses, and other organizations to make decisions that can drive positive action for people and our planet.
The opportunity we have through our products and 
platforms is reflected in our updated environmental sustainability strategy, which focuses on where we can make the most significant positive impact. Our work is organized around three key pillars: empowering individuals to take action, working together with our partners and customers, and operating our business sustainably.
In 2022, we reached our goal to help 1 billion people 
make more sustainable choices through our products. We achieved this by offering sustainability features like eco-friendly routing in Google Maps, energy efficiency features in Google Nest thermostats, and carbon emissions information in Google Flights. Looking ahead, our aspiration is to help individuals, cities, and other partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.

After two years of condensed reporting, we’re sharing a deeper dive into our approach in one place in our 2023 Environmental Report. In 2022, we continued to make measurable progress in many key ways, such as:
• We enhanced and launched new sustainabilityproduct features , such as eco-friendly routing in
Maps, which is estimated to have helped preventmore than 1.2 million metric tons of carbon emissionsfrom launch through 2022—equivalent to takingapproximately 250,000 fuel-based cars off the roadfor a year.
 3
• We expanded the availability of Google EarthEngine —which provides access to reliable, up-to-
date insights on how our planet is changing—toinclude businesses and governments worldwide as anenterprise-grade service through Google Cloud.• We opened our new Bay View campus , which is
all-electric, net water-positive, restores over 17 acresof high-value nature, and incorporates the leadingprinciples of circular design.
• We signed 20 more renewable energy agreements,bringing our total to more than 80 agreementstotaling approximately 10 GW of clean energygeneration capacity—we estimate we’ll spendapproximately $10 billion to purchase clean energythrough 2040.
 4
We expect this new era of technological innovation to open up even greater opportunities to accelerate system-level change. It’s a big part of the reason we’re optimistic about what’s possible in the years ahead. If we move forward collectively and decisively, there’s no limit to  what we can achieve.

2023 Environmental Report  
Emerging opportunities
As the world becomes increasingly aware of the need for sustainability, individuals, businesses, and communities are  
looking for new ways to reduce their environmental impact. Artificial intelligence (AI) and the power of information to help individuals and organizations reduce emissions are two emerging opportunities that Google is focusing on to help build a more sustainable future.
AI for sustainability
Seven years into our journey as an AI-first company, we’ve made AI foundational  to every part of our business and 
all Google products. Our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible . To us, that means developing AI in a 
way that maximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges, guided by our AI Principles . 
We can use AI to help accelerate solutions to tackle climate change by providing better information  to 
individuals, operational optimization  for organizations, 
and improved prediction  and forecasting. We must 
also continue to find ways to reduce the environmental footprint  of AI models.
Information: Empowering people to live more sustainably through AI.  In 2022, searches for  
   “solar energy,”       “electric bicycles,”    and  
   “electric cars”   reached all-time highs. 13 People are 
interested in how to live more sustainably, and our goal is to make it easier for them to do so. Features like eco-friendly routing in Google Maps leverage AI to help people get to their destinations as quickly as possible while minimizing fuel or battery consumption. Eco-friendly routing has helped prevent 1.2 million metric tons of estimated carbon emissions since launch—equivalent to taking approximately 250,
000 fuel-based cars off the road for a year. 14 
Additionally, for over a decade, our Nest Learning Thermostats have used machine learning (ML) to help people save energy and money at home. From 2011 to 2022, Nest thermostats have helped customers cumulatively save more than 113 billion kWh of energy
 15—more than double Portugal’s annual electricity 
consumption 16 and equivalent to avoiding an estimated  
36 million tCO2e emissions. 17 
Optimization: Bringing carbon-efficient computing to customers and partners.  We’ve made significant 
investments in cleaner cloud computing by making our data centers some of the most efficient in the world and sourcing more carbon-free energy. We’re helping our customers make real-time decisions to reduce emissions, and mitigate climate risks with data and AI. For example, Google Cloud customers can reduce their cloud footprint with a feature called Active Assist, which uses machine learning to identify unused (and potentially wasteful) workloads that could reduce carbon emissions if removed.

We believe that AI is a foundational and transformational technology that will provide compelling and helpful 
benefits to people and society through its capacity to assist, complement, empower, and inspire people in almost every field of human endeavor. It has the potential to contribute to tackling some of society’s most pressing challenges and opportunities—among these, climate and sustainability, where we’re researching and innovating to help unlock scientific discoveries and to assist people in making informed choices and communities impacted by climate change. 
We believe that getting AI right—which to us involves innovating and delivering widely accessible benefits to 
people and society, while mitigating its risks—must be a collective effort involving us and others, including researchers, developers, users (individuals, businesses, and other organizations), governments, regulators, and citizens. It’s critical that we collectively earn public trust if AI is to deliver on its potential for people and society. As a company, we embrace the opportunity to work with others to get AI right.

2023 Environmental Report  
We’re making advancements  in many 
transformative areas of AI, but I’m particularly 
excited about AI for Social Good, including  climate adaptation. AI has great potential to  both reduce overall emissions as well as help us address the effects of climate change, including helping people adapt to new challenges.
Jeff DeanChief ScientistGoogle DeepMind and 
Google R
esearch
Optimization: Helping communities with AI-powered climate action planning.  Green Light is an AI-based tool 
that helps city traffic engineers optimize the timing of  light changes to reduce stop-and-go traffic. Our recent tests in Hamburg, Germany, showed that at traffic lights with our AI-driven recommendations, cars made over 25% fewer stops, resulting in approximately 10% fewer emissions.
 18 The Environmental Insights Explorer  (EIE) is 
a freely available online tool built with and for cities and regions to support effective climate action planning. Many features in EIE are made possible through machine learning, such as estimating the solar potential of rooftops, calculating transportation emissions, and mapping tree canopy coverage. 
Prediction: Using AI to help communities address 
extreme weather events.  AI-powered tools can help 
address some of the worst impacts of climate-related disasters , from early warnings of natural disasters to 
reducing the impact of wildfires. In 2022, we launched Flood Hub, which allows local governments and aid organizations to identify when a riverine flood will occur, up to seven days in advance. In early 2023, we expanded this tool from 20 to 80 countries across the globe. By using AI to analyze satellite imagery, we’re also helping to enable rapid detection when a wildfire starts and to predict how it will spread, enabling authorities to better manage fires and provide emergency alerts to individuals who are at risk.
Prediction: Using AI to predict locust outbreaks, 
helping farmers protect their crops. Locust infestations can have a devastating effect on food crops. Through collaborations with AI product-focused company InstaDeep and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the Google AI Center in Ghana is building a model  that forecasts locust 
breeding grounds using historical data from the FAO and environmental variables like rainfall and temperature. This model will help to better detect locust outbreaks and enable farmers to implement control measures.
Prediction: Using generative modeling for nowcasting 
rain. We’re using generative modeling  to make detailed 
and plausible predictions, up to two hours ahead, that capture the amount, timing, and location of rainfall. With such methods, we can both accurately capture large-scale events, while also generating alternative rain scenarios. We’re interested in the ability of these models to make predictions on medium- to heavy-rain events, which most impact people and the economy.
Environmental footprint: Leveraging AI to optimize 
our own operations, and working to reduce energy use and emissions from AI computing in our data centers.  
AI and machine learning workloads are quickly becoming larger and more capable, raising concerns about their energy use and their impact on the environment. With AI at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. Historically, research  has shown 
that as AI/ML compute demand has gone up, the energy needed to power this technology has increased at a much slower rate than many forecasts predicted. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large margins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1,000x. We plan to continue applying these tested practices and to keep developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient.
Google data centers are designed, built, and operated to 
maximize efficiency—even as computing demand grows. On average, a Google-owned and -operated data center is more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center
 19 and, compared with five years 
ago, we now deliver approximately three times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power.
 20 To support the next generation of fundamental 
advances in AI, our latest TPU v4  is proven to be one 
of the fastest, most efficient , and most sustainable ML 
infrastructure hubs in the world.We’re excited about the progress we’ve already made 
in developing more sustainable tools and products that harness the power of AI, and we’re optimistic about the progress we’ll unlock in the years ahead.
AI is one of the most transformational 
technologies of our time. I believe it has  the potential to unlock major benefits for  us all, including tackling climate change.  At Google DeepMind, we’re committed to driving responsible research that can make  a positive and lasting impact on society.  I’m hopeful AI will accelerate scientific progress and help us address a number of global challenges to leave the world a better place for the generations that follow.

Our gigaton aspiration
We believe that Google has a unique 
opportunity that extends beyond reducing the environmental impacts of our own operations and value chain.
 21 
In 2020, Google shared our aspiration to help others reduce 
1 gigaton (GT) of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030. This is an ambitious vision that we’ve set to push us to contribute meaningfully to helping with climate solutions beyond our own operations and value chain.
We initially focused on helping cities and local 
governments reduce 1 GT of emissions. A key tool in this effort is the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE), which provides actionable climate and sustainability data to government officials in cities and regions worldwide. It’s been used in multiple ways across the globe, including by city leaders in Dublin to analyze bicycle usage and inform smart transportation policies, and by the city of Austin to prioritize planting trees in areas with the highest need.
To better reflect the broader group of partners we aim to 
help, we’re updating our shared ambition:
ASPIRATION
We aim to help individuals, cities,  
and other partners collectively reduce 1 gigaton of their carbon equivalent emissions annually by 2030.For context, 1 GT is comparable to the entire annual 
emissions of Japan. 22 Helping others to reduce 1 GT of 
carbon equivalent emissions per year, starting in 2030, is a bold aspiration focused on where we can have the most impact—enabling others to reduce emissions in key areas like energy and transportation. Our ultimate measure of success will be how much we’ve helped individuals, cities, and other partners to achieve their own greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals.
Many of the solutions to achieve a gigaton of carbon 
emission reductions don’t yet exist. However this ambition pushes us to innovate and be audacious in our approach and to collaborate with others to drive systemic solutions. We’ll share progress and learnings along the way.
Estimating impact
Estimating the carbon impact of actions taken by many millions of people, communities, and organizations will be inherently difficult, imprecise, and fundamentally different from measuring a corporate carbon footprint. However, it’s also useful to enable us to prioritize the most helpful solutions for others. 
After reviewing emerging best practices and applying our 
internal product measurement expertise to advance our measurement work, we’ve identified a set of approaches and known challenges that will inform how we estimate enabled emissions reductions.Approaches
Consider carbon accounting principles Established carbon accounting principles (such as well-defined baselines and true and fair representation of data) provide helpful insights as we develop estimation methodologies for enabled emissions reductions.
Quantify and evaluate real world action 
The data available to us from our technology, products, or services may be several steps removed from actual, real-world action and impact that resulted in reduced or avoided emissions. We’ll have to use inference and judgment to evaluate the effect of those actions.
Challenges
Unintended impactsEmissions reduction efforts don’t happen in isolation. Actions in one industry or sector might result in net new emissions in another. Similarly, emissions reductions in one area can sometimes lead to increases in another. These are difficult effects to control for, but they must be considered when estimating enabled emissions reductions. Inherent uncertainty  
Uncertainty is inherent to most GHG accounting methodologies and results, and it increases when considering enabled emissions reductions due to a lack of primary data and precise information about real-world actions and their effects. However, understanding the sources, types, and magnitude of uncertainty is crucial to deploy conservative estimates, inform improved data inputs, and properly interpret results.
While carbon accounting principles and these concepts 
are a good start towards estimating enabled emissions reductions, we expect that methodologies will rapidly evolve, and we welcome the opportunity to collaborate with others to advance best practices. 
The Empowering individuals  and Working together  
sections include many examples of how we’re already 
supporting and enabling individuals and partners to reduce their emissions.

2023 Environmental Report  Our ambition
At Google, we have an opportunity to lead 
the transition to a more sustainable future by making information accessible and by driving innovation forward. Grounded in our mission, we’re empowering people with the high-quality information they’re looking for. Through our products and platforms that billions of users engage with every day, we’re helping people make decisions that can drive positive action for our planet.
Last year’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) AR6 Working Group 3 Report , for the first time, 
set out measurable ways that individuals can take meaningful climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. The IPCC report offers a detailed and practical plan for societal emissions reduction, complementing the critical action required by governments, policymakers, and organizations to decarbonize energy, transport, and material systems. The report also calculates the significant well-being and economic benefits that will result from these actions, including for individuals.
These important findings have reinforced our conviction 
that Google can make a meaningful difference beyond our own operations and value chain, and they highlight the benefits of helping individuals through our products and platforms.Our approach
Every day, billions of people turn to Google to ask questions, discover something new, or learn about what’s important to them. More people are interested in how to live more sustainably than ever, and our aim is to make it easier for them to do so. In 2022, searches for   
   “solar energy,”        “electric bicycles,”   and  
   “electric cars”   reached all-time highs. 23 
These kinds of changes to lifestyles and behavior matter: the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates  that 
around 55% of the cumulative emissions reductions needed to achieve a net-zero global energy system by 2050 are linked to consumer choices. Yet, there’s a wide “say-do gap ” among consumers—between those who are 
concerned about sustainability, and those who ultimately make sustainable decisions.
 24 
To tackle a problem at the scale of climate change, it can be hard to know where to start. That’s why we’ve taken a first-principles approach, looking at what’s contributing the most to global emissions. Home energy  
and transportation  are two such areas—collectively 
they account for more than 20% of emissions.
 25 They’re 
also sectors where people are actively searching for sustainable alternatives that often provide benefits like saving them money or time, or improving their health.
The accuracy and quality of the information that informs 
these decisions is critical. When people come to us looking for answers, we aim to provide high-quality and authoritative information.FIGURE 1

2023 Environmental Report  Helping people make more  
sustainable choices
In 2020, we announced a goal to help 1 billion people make 
more sustainable choices through our products by 2022. We’re pleased to share that we reached that goal in 2022, through innovative solutions offered to users, including:

Reducing home 
energy use
We’ve launched a number of products and features to 
help people make more informed choices about the products they buy and the energy they use.
Energy-efficient 
products
Searches for    “how to save energy ”   reached a 10-year 
high, worldwide, in 2022. 26 And global searches for 
   “heat pumps ”   reached an all-time high in 2022. 27 
When someone uses Google Search in the U.S. to look for 
furnaces or water heaters, suggestions in the Shopping tab can help narrow their search to cost-effective and efficient options (see Figure 2).FIGURE 2

2023 Environmental Report  Smart thermostats
Nest thermostats  help control residential heating and 
cooling systems, saving energy  in a variety of ways. 
The collective impact of these savings is significant. 
From 2011 to 2022, Nest thermostats have helped customers cumulatively save more than 113 billion kWh of energy
 28—more than double Portugal’s annual 
electricity consumption 29—and equivalent to preventing 
an estimated 36 million tCO2e emissions. 30 In 2022 alone, 
Nest thermostats helped customers save more than  26 billion kWh of energy
 31—more energy than Google used 
in the same year.
Nest thermostats use AI and machine learning 
to reduce energy consumption and achieve collective savings as they learn how and when to keep customers comfortable, while optimizing for energy efficiency.
Clean energy
Because electricity grids tend to be cleaner at certain times of day, when  we use electricity can be as important 
as how much  electricity we use. That’s why we launched 
Nest Renew in the United States to help individuals automatically shift their energy consumption to times of day when local grid electricity is cleaner or less expensive Features such as Energy Shift gather local power grid emissions forecasts and identify opportunities where heating or cooling a home slightly earlier or later would mean taking advantage of cleaner energy. These small actions add up; as of December 2022, we estimate that Energy Shift
 32 has already helped Nest Renew users 33 
collectively prioritize cleaner energy usage for more than 110 million hours. 
For people who want to do more to support the growth 
of clean energy from their homes, Google offers Nest Renew Premium as a paid subscription option. It matches the fossil fuel electricity used in their home with enough clean energy to cover the average U.S. household. We’re working with renewable energy plants that support projects in Google’s own portfolio—like the Bethel Wind plant in Castro County, Texas—to purchase high-quality renewable energy credits  for Nest Renew customers, 
beyond Google’s existing clean energy purchases. 
People can also access features like impact reports and 
the Energy Impact Program , which lets them direct Nest 
Renew funds to nonprofit partners working toward an equitable sustainable future (see Figure 3).

2023 Environmental Report  Information about 
energy
Global search interest in    “eco-anxiety”   reached a 
15-y
ear high in 2022, as did search interest in how to  
   “save energy at home,”   35 showing us that people 
want—and need answers.
Due to the energy crisis in Europe, people, businesses, 
and governments across the continent are concerned about rising prices and increased pressure on the energy grid, which is evident from the information they’re searching for. 
In 2022, we worked with the IEA to rapidly develop a set 
of recommendations  to help individuals reduce energy 
use at home. When people searched for topics such as “Europe energy crisis” and “energy price”, they saw news articles, local information including financial assistance that may be available, and recommended actions to help conserve energy (see Figure 4).FIGURE 4
Europe energy information panels
Going solar
Global search interest in    “solar energy”   and 
  “solar installation”   reached all-time highs in 2022. 36 
Project Sunroof , launched in 2015 in the United States 
and Puerto Rico, helps people decide whether to go solar. It uses AI to analyze high-resolution aerial mapping and 3D modeling of residential roofs, making estimations of solar potential faster and easier.

2023 Environmental Report  Providing sustainable transportation 
options
Global search interest in    “sustainable transport”   
reached a 15-year high in 2022. 37 Transportation relies 
more heavily on fossil fuels than any other sector. 38 
This is why, for people in most high-income countries, 
changing travel patterns is a high-impact way to reduce their footprint. We’ve added several features across our products to allow people to more easily make sustainable travel and transportation decisions.
Eco-friendly routing
A simple thing everyone can do to reduce emissions is  use existing vehicles more efficiently. Global searches for 
   “how to save fuel when driving”    have increased by 
60% between 2022 and 2023. 39 In 2021, we launched eco-
friendly routing in Google Maps to help people get to their destinations as quickly as possible while minimizing fuel or battery consumption (see Figure 5). By building AI models on the emissions profile of diverse vehicle types, this feature leverages insights from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory and data from the European Environment Agency to optimize fuel-efficient route choices.FIGURE 5
Eco-friendly routing
In 2022
, we expanded eco-friendly routing  to Canada 
and nearly 40 European countries, as well as in Egypt ahead of COP-27. As of the end of 2022, it’s estimated to have helped prevent more than 1.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions since launch—equivalent to taking approximately 250,000 fuel-based cars off the road for a year.
 40 Since the most fuel-efficient route will vary by engine type, d
rivers using eco-friendly routing in Europe, Egypt, 
the U.S., and Canada can now select their engine type—petrol or gas, diesel, hybrid, or electric vehicle (EV)—in order to get the best route and most accurate fuel or energy efficiency estimates.
Electric vehicles
EVs accounted for nearly 14% of new global car sales in 2022,
 41 and global search interest for    “electric vehicles”      
reached an all-time high in 2022. 42
For people considering purchasing a new vehicle, we want to make it easy to understand when switching to a hybrid or electric vehicle makes sense for them. Search can help people figure out how much they can save by going electric by providing fuel savings estimates and information about how similar cars compare in range and emissions . We also sh
 ow which models qualify in 
the U.S. under the latest government rebate  programs  
designed to help make EVs a more affordable option. For people considering a new bike or scooter, in select Asian countries, Search provides information such as range, speed, and price for electric bikes and scooters.
When EV owners search for 
   “EV charging”   on Google 
Maps, they’ll see charging stations nearby with charger 
availability displayed in some cases. People with a car that has Google Maps built in are routed to the most convenient charging location based on factors like traffic, charge levels, and charger speed. By the end of 2022, Google Maps included nearly 300,000 EV charging locations globally.
In the Waze app , individuals can also find compatible 
charging stations along their route. Thanks to local map 
editors from our Waze Community, EV data is reviewed and updated in real time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information.

2023 Environmental Report  Sustainable commuting
One sustainable way to travel is to avoid driving 
altogether, which is why we’re making it easier to use Google Maps for sustainable commuting in urban areas, by providing mass transit options, bike routes , bike 
shares , and walking directions.
By tapping on the Google Maps transit icon, individuals can get directions to their destination by bus, train, subway, and even ferry. Google Maps provides, on average, more than 2 billion kilometers (1.2 billion miles) of public transit results per day.
Global searches for 
   “e-bikes”   have doubled over 
the past three years. 43 In 2022, we added over 90,000 
kilometers (56,000 miles) of bike lanes  and bikeable 
roads  to Google Maps. Individuals can also find nearby 
bike and scooter shares in over 400 cities around  
the world.
We’re also helping people get from point A to point B  
on foot. Google Maps offers turn-by-turn directions  
for pedestrians, with Immersive View and Street View offering route previews, and Live View , which uses 
augmented reality to display arrows and directions  clearly overlaid on the map.
2022 HIGHLIGHT
Google Maps provides, on average, 
more than 2 billion kilometers  (1.2 billion miles) of public transit results per day.Long-distance travel
When individuals search in Google Flights, they now see 
carbon emissions estimates  for nearly every flight, right 
next to price and duration (see Figure 6). Lower emissions flights are labeled with a green badge, and results can  be sorted or filtered by carbon impact. If people want to  view only flights that have lower emissions compared to the average for similar trips, they can simply tap the  “Less emissions only ” filter. In 2022, we expanded 
coverage of carbon emissions estimates to 99% of itineraries on Google Flights. 
FIGURE 6
Google Flights emissions estimates
We also cre
ated the Travel Impact Model (TIM) ,  
a public and freely accessible methodology for predicting the per-passenger CO
2 emissions produced by an 
upcoming flight. Today, the TIM powers the emissions estimates you see on Google Flights , as well as select 
travel sites, through our work in the Travalyst coalition . Over time, we’ve refined and improved the TIM with help from academic and nonprofit experts, as well as various partners in the travel industry. We then formalized these collaborative efforts  by establishing an independent 
advisory committee to oversee future changes to the TIM. 
Google Search can also help people find more 
sustainable alternatives to flying  when available. 
Trips taken by train or bus often produce lower emissions and can frequently save individuals time or money over shorter distances. 
People can now compare train ticket prices directly on 
Google Search for travel in and around select countries. As an example, when looking for 
   “Berlin to Vienna trains,”   
individuals will see a new module in the search results that lets them choose their departure date and compare the available options. To further expand individual choices for intercity travel, we’ve also started testing a similar feature for bus tickets.
Hotel accommodations
When people search for travel accommodations, they can see which hotels have been certified for meeting high standards of sustainability by select independent organizations. For example, hotels certified by Green Key or EarthCheck will have an eco-certified badge  next to 
their name.   19
2023 Environmental Report  Sharing other actionable information
Outside of home energy and transportation, individuals 
can make other sustainable choices that add up to create a positive impact. This includes understanding local air quality, accessing climate change information, identifying nearby recycling locations, or purchasing pre-owned items.
Air quality
Air quality around the world is being negatively impacted by air pollution and increasingly severe wildfires. We’ve added a new Air Quality feature in Google Search and Maps that shows the air quality conditions for the day, whether it’s unusually smoggy or dangerously smoky. Available in cities in the U.S., Singapore, Brazil, and Chile, among other locations, this data can help people consider their activities for the day, including whether to stay indoors.
Google Maps and Waze both support user alerts for  
clean air zones . A clean air zone is a designated 
urban area with high air pollution where measures are implemented to improve air quality, such as charging an entry fee to drivers of high-emissions vehicles. If a route crosses a clean air zone, the driver will be alerted to add a permit if they own one, then eligible routes will be suggested for them based on that pass.Climate change 
information
We’re making it easier for people to find climate change 
information. When people search for    “climate change”    
in certain languages, they’ll see information panels and visuals on the causes and effects of climate change, and individual actions they can take to live more sustainably, provided by authoritative sources  like the United Nations .
We’re also engaging with individuals on climate and other environmental topics via YouTube . On Earth Day 2022, 
we launched a Non-Fungible Planet campaign, where we teamed up with environmental non-profits, creators, and other organizations to show what makes Earth so special and worth protecting. They journeyed to one-of-a-kind locales and created videos to highlight the stress our environment is under and what we can do to help. In 2022, YouTube also held our first ever Creators for Climate Action summits, one in New York and one with TED Countdown  in London. 
To stay safe during extreme weather events, people often 
turn to the internet with questions. For example, global search interest in 
  “heat waves”   reached an all-time 
high in July 2022. 44 To surface authoritative and helpful 
information in these moments, we’re providing information through Search alerts on flooding , wildfire boundaries , and 
extreme heat . More details on how AI enables these alerts 
can be found in the Working together  section.Recycling points
People recognize that recycling plays a crucial role in preserving the future of our planet; global searches for  
   “recycling”   are the highest of any sustainability action. 45 
In 2021, we launched a new feature that makes it easier for people to find nearby recycling points on Search and Maps. In addition to providing information on recycling depots  
and waste transfer stations, we’re also helping small businesses  share when they offer in-store recycling . By 
adding the new recycling attribute  to Business Profiles on 
Search and Maps, local storefronts and shops can show  the recycling services they offer in just a few clicks—whether it’s for plastic bottles, packaging, or electronics.
Pre-owned items
Global search interest in    “slow fashion”   reached  
a 15-year high in 2022. 46 And global searches for  
   “thrifting”   have nearly tripled over the most recent 
three-year period compared to the previous three-year period,
 47 reaching a 15-year high in 2022. 48 The apparel 
industry is responsible for nearly 7% of global carbon emissions, so clothing choices have a big impact on reducing both waste and emissions.
 49 
Buying pre-owned items is a small action people can take to live more sustainably. In 2022, we launched enhancements  to the Google Shopping experience in  
the United States for pre-owned products, such as used and refurbished products. The journey 
ahead
While a single individual’s actions may seem small, when 
billions of people have the tools to make more sustainable decisions, they add up to have a meaningful impact on their communities and the entire planet. 
We’re excited by the opportunity to enable climate and 
environmental action far beyond Google’s direct impact, through information and innovation.

2023 Environmental Report  Our ambition
We believe that Google has a unique 
opportunity that extends beyond reducing 
the environmental impacts of our own 
operations and value chain. By organizing 
information about our planet and making 
it actionable through technology and 
platforms, we can help partners and 
customers create even more positive impact.
Digital technologies  play a critical role in industry 
transitions, allowing us to measure and track sustainability 
progress, optimize the use of resources, reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, and enable a more circular 
economy. 50 Cloud computing and digital technologies 
underpin the transformation in many sectors, such as 
energy, transportation, and agriculture. Research  that 
we commissioned in 2022 found that 20%–25% of what’s 
required for the EU’s 2050 net-zero goal requires some 
sort of digital enablement. 51
Our approach
By combining Google’s suite of unique capabilities in 
data, geospatial analytics, cloud computing, and AI, 
we’re enabling our partners and customers to advance 
sustainability goals. Data
To effectively mitigate and adapt to climate change and 
protect ecosystems, organizations need a data-driven 
understanding of their impacts. Currently, much of this data 
is fragmented across thousands of silos and a multitude 
of databases. To help solve this problem, we’ve curated a 
large catalog of Earth observation datasets in the Earth 
Engine Data Catalog . We created Environmental Insights 
Explorer , which empowers thousands of cities and regions 
with actionable data and insights to reduce global emissions. 
More recently, we also built Data Commons , an open-
source tool to organize hundreds of public sustainability 
datasets into a single, accessible resource.
Geospatial technology
Google has made deep investments over nearly two 
decades in geospatial technology and platforms such 
as Google Maps and Google Earth. Google Earth Engine 
is a leading technology platform for planetary-scale 
environmental monitoring that was launched in 2010 
for scientists and NGOs. In 2022, it was expanded for 
commercial use by businesses and governments as 
an enterprise-grade service through Google Cloud. 
Researchers from academic institutions, NGOs, and 
intergovernmental organizations have leveraged and 
built upon our tools for a wide variety of use cases from 
measuring habitat ranges to protecting forest  and  
ocean  ecosystems.
Cloud
Google Cloud is helping to transform  a number of carbon-
emitting sectors, such as energy , transportation , and 
agriculture . We’ve made significant investments in cleaner 
cloud computing by making our data centers among the most efficient in the world and sourcing more carbon-free 
energy. This enables others to expand their use of digital 
technologies in a more sustainable way, by monitoring and 
optimizing cloud-related emissions, and choosing cleaner 
regions in which to run their workloads.
AI
As an AI-first company, we’ve established a track record of 
applying AI to some of the most significant challenges facing 
humanity, such as environmental degradation and climate change, and we see exciting opportunities for further 
impact. AI is embedded into many of our sustainability 
initiatives—including detecting and forecasting floods and 
wildfires , helping people and cities adapt to extreme heat , 
and protecting critical species habitat .  
We’re leveraging this unique suite of capabilities in three key 
ways: supporting partners, investing in breakthrough 
innovation , and creating ecosystems for collaboration .
Governments, aid organizations, and individuals can use Flood Hub to take timely action and prepare for riverine floods,  
seeing locally relevant flood data and forecasts up to 7 days in advance.   22
2023 Environmental Report  Supporting partners
We’re building partnerships to advance sustainability 
goals through technology across three key groups: governments and intergovernmental organizations; customers and commercial partners; and researchers, academics, and NGOs.
Governments and 
intergovernmental organizations
We’re creating tools to help governments and 
intergovernmental organizations make decisions on key topics—such as urban infrastructure, transportation systems, regulations, and investments —that have a 
significant, long-term impact on people and our planet. Cities and urban areas are a particular focus for our work, since they’re home to a large proportion of the global population and produce a significant amount of GHG emissions. More than half the world’s population now lives in urban areas, with this number expected to grow to 68% by 2050,
 52 and cities account for 70% of energy-related 
carbon dioxide emissions globally. 53
Environmental Insights 
Explorer
Google created Environmental Insights Explorer  (EIE) with 
and for cities and regions. This freely available online tool 
brings many of our technological advancements together to help measure emission sources, analyze data, identify strategies to reduce emissions, and adapt to climate change impacts. EIE is supported and offered to cities  for validation by leading city networks including the  
Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy (GCoM),  
C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, ICLEI, and others.
EIE makes actionable climate data available to more than 
40,000 cities and regions worldwide. Over a thousand cities globally have signed up to view their data and use the insights for their GHG inventories and climate action planning. For example, Iniciativa Climática de México is working with city officials to evaluate Mexico City’s building emissions and the potential to generate renewable energy from rooftop solar, using data from EIE, and support from Google.org and ICLEI. 
Building emissions
In 2022, EIE released building emissions data for 4,000 new cities, bringing our total buildings data coverage to over 13,000 cities worldwide. We’ve substantially increased our geographic coverage of the world, improving it by over 250%—from just over 9.5 million square kilometers to over 35 million square kilometers—resulting in over 50% more buildings counted and 40% more building floor area used to estimate emissions.
Transportation emissions
Using anonymized traffic patterns and other geospatial information, EIE is also able to estimate transportation emissions for trips within a city’s boundary. For example, in Izmir, Turkey’s third most populous city, transportation emissions accounted for almost 23% of total city emissions in 2018.
 54 Izmir is using EIE to assess the effectiveness of 
GHG emissions mitigation actions and apply them to policy and decision-making to align with the goals defined in the city’s Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan.
Tree canopy coverage
EIE also provides Tree Canopy Insights, which uses AI and aerial imagery to detect and map tree canopy coverage in cities (see Figure 7) to help them create cooler environments. As of March 2023, we expanded our coverage to more than 350 cities on four continents. For example, the city of Austin has used the EIE Tree Canopy tool to prioritize planting trees in vulnerable areas and help place bus shelters to increase shade.
FIGURE 7
EIE Tree Canopy Insights
Tree Canopy Insights uses AI and aerial 
imagery to detect and map tree canopy coverage in cities.   23
2023 Environmental Report  Air quality
Google has worked with several cities to capture 
hyperlocal air quality insights used to help improve the lives and health of residents. We partnered with Dublin City Council to map air quality street-by-street using an electric Street View car, to increase awareness of air quality levels and help implement smart transportation policies. We also partnered with New York state to launch a statewide air quality and greenhouse gas mobile monitoring initiative  in areas overburdened by 
environmental pollution. 
Road traffic
We also know that many cities suffer from urban road traffic, which wastes fuel and creates harmful air pollution. That’s why we created Green Light , an AI tool that 
measures driving trends at intersections and develops recommendations that city traffic engineers can use to optimize the timing of light changes to reduce stop-and-go traffic. Our recent tests in Hamburg, Germany showed that at traffic lights with our AI-driven recommendations, cars made over 25% fewer stops, resulting in approximately 10% fewer emissions at intersections.
 55 
Cool roofs
Cool roofs are designed to reflect sunlight and absorb less heat, and they’re especially impactful in communities that may not have access to reliable air conditioning. We’re exploring how our technology—such as AI algorithms and aerial imagery—can help more places implement cool roofs . We’re able to map out the solar reflectivity of cities 
so urban planners and governments can identify what areas would benefit most from cool roofs. We’ll soon begin piloting this tool with select cities.We’re exploring how AI and aerial 
imagery can be used to help cities and governments address “heat islands”  
by implementing cool roofs in  relevant locations. 
Adaptation support for 
communities
As climate change increases extreme weather events 
around the world, we’re also helping communities adapt to environmental changes and stay one step ahead of natural disasters. 
Wildfire detection and prediction
Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires, which are having a devastating impact on communities and ecosystems around the world.
 56 To 
minimize the impact of wildfires on communities, Google has developed a new AI-based technology to map wildfires in near real time. It uses data from geostationary satellites such as NOAA’s GOES constellation to show the size of a wildfire, with data being refreshed roughly every 15–20 minutes. Additionally, we’re collaborating with the USFS on wildfire research by using advanced simulation and AI techniques to accelerate their fire spread model.
 57
We’ve also been working closely with U.S. agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). USFS used Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud technology to build a Landscape Change Monitoring System to map and monitor land cover change  across the United States and support forest planning 
and post-fire recovery. Flood forecasting
Annually, floods cause thousands of fatalities worldwide, 58 
disrupt the lives of millions, and cause significant financial damages. 
Our Flood Forecasting Initiative , launched in 2018, uses 
AI to predict when and where riverine flooding will occur, 
helping to keep people safe and informed. Our Flood Hub  
platform now displays flood forecasts to help governments, aid organizations, and at-risk communities take timely action. These breakthroughs are a result of innovative modeling approaches  that use machine learning to create scalable 
models in real-world settings.
In May 2023, we expanded coverage to territories in 60 new 
countries across Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, 
We’re applying AI and working with fire 
authorities to detect, track, and predict wildfires, and to help authorities respond better to new wildfire threats.
From wildfire mapping, to earthquake detection and alerts to flood forecasting, we continue to find new ways for technology to be helpful at the most critical times.   24
2023 Environmental Report  Europe, and South and Central America. Flood Hub now 
displays forecasts for 80 countries. This includes some of 
the territories with the highest percentages of population exposed to flood risk and experiencing more extreme weather, covering 460 million people globally. All forecasts are displayed for free.
We’re applying advanced machine learning 
methods to forecast when and where riverine floods may occur, up to seven days in advance, helping to save lives and livelihoods.
Risk to infrastructure and natural 
resources
In 2022, we announced our Google Cloud climate insights 
offerings  to help government agencies better understand 
the risks to infrastructure and natural resources due to climate change.
For example, we partnered with the State of Hawaii 
Department of Transportation (HDOT), which manages 2,500 miles of highway—much of which is facing risks due to erosion and sea level rise. HDOT is leveraging Google Earth Engine and other Google Cloud services for its Climate Resilience Platform, using big data and insights  to assess risk and prioritize investment decisions based on multiple climate risks, asset conditions, and community impact.Water security
We’re putting Google’s products and technology in service of helping others to study and respond to water security challenges. Improving water security requires an accurate accounting of freshwater resources and how they change over time.
As an example, we partnered with the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre to develop the Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer . Following the launch of 
the Sustainable Development Goals, UNEP requested that all 193 member states provide indicator 6.6.1 data on the extent of their water-related ecosystems.
 59 At that time, 
the majority of member states couldn’t report on this metric. To fill this gap, the Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer (sdg661.app) helps to quantify and visualize surface water changes  over the course of decades. This free, 
easy-to-use geospatial platform and data product helps decision-makers access national, sub-national, and basin-level data on freshwater ecosystems (see Figure 8).FIGURE 8
Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer
The Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer helps to quantify and visualize surface water changes.
In addition to other water outflows, freshwater is 
transferred to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration. Together with government and academic research  groups and the nonprofit OpenET , Google has helped 
improve water management by supporting the automation and scaling of evapotranspiration (ET) models . These models provide estimates of how much 
water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere, a crucial but difficult to measure process within the overall hydrological cycle. Now OpenET is making satellite-based ET data widely accessible to farmers, landowners, and water managers.    25
2023 Environmental Report  Cloud customers and 
commercial partners
We’re collaborating with customers and commercial 
partners across a number of sectors—including energy, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, consumer goods, and financial services—to work towards sustainability goals. 
We’re providing powerful insights to help our Google 
Cloud customers around the world predict climate risk, increase visibility across their supply chain, and reduce and report on their emissions.
Carbon footprinting
In 2022, we introduced the Carbon Sense Suite , which 
includes products such as Carbon Footprint and Active Assist, and tools such as Cloud region picker . The suite is 
enabling Google Cloud customers to accurately measure, report, and reduce their cloud-related carbon emissions. We help developers and organizations make low-carbon architecture decisions and provide best practices to improve sustainability.
Developers at companies such as L’O réal  and SAP  are 
using Google Cloud tools to reduce the emissions 
associated with their technology footprint. Working closely with these customers, we developed our Carbon Footprint  product—a freely available tool that provides 
monthly emissions data on a per service, project, and region basis. The data can be accessed in BigQuery for analysis and can be easily integrated with popular carbon accounting tools. Carbon Footprint data is also integrated with recommendations  to reduce emissions.Climate risk and resilience
Many of our commercial customers are eager to assess and improve their resilience to climate change. From transportation companies to financial service organizations, Google is helping organizations integrate climate data and geospatial analysis into business strategy and risk management. For example, we partnered with RSMetrics and Infosys to publish a design pattern for portfolio climate risk analysis and we’re helping insurers boost responses to disaster-related claims .
We’ve launched SpatiaFi , together with our partner 
Climate Engine, to help the banking sector harness the power of geospatial analytics to support climate finance. For example, geospatial data can help a bank’s agriculture customers build a personalized picture of flood and drought risks and biodiversity at a field-specific level.
Responsible sourcing
As global demand for raw materials continues to grow, deforestation is increasing, contributing to GHG emissions. Companies want to know more about the origins of their raw materials, including which are sourced responsibly—and how they can improve their sourcing practices.
Google Cloud, in partnership with NGIS (a geospatial 
solutions company) is helping brands gain a deeper understanding of sustainable sourcing practices  across 
supplier networks. By combining the power of our cloud computing, AI, and geospatial analytics, we’re helping companies get real-time, reliable information into operations at a local supplier level, globally. For example, we’re helping Unilever build a more holistic view of the forests, water cycles, and biodiversity that intersect its supply chain. We also helped launch TraceMark , a 
Google Cloud Ready – Sustainability Solution designed for enterprises, which aims to accelerate the delivery of traceability and transparency in global supply chains for raw materials.
Transportation-related 
emissions
We’re working with a number of commercial organizations 
to tackle transportation-related emissions. Ecommerce shipments are on track to double by 2026,

2023 Environmental Report  Researchers, academics, 
and NGOs
We’re providing cutting-edge climate- and nature-related 
data and analytics to scientific researchers from academic institutions and NGOs. This support is enabling advances in the most complex areas of their fields, applying AI, machine learning, and geospatial analytics at a global scale to accelerate the shift to a sustainable future.   
Planetary-scale platforms
Launched in 2010, Google Earth Engine is Google’s planetary-scale platform for Earth science data and analysis. It offers over 1,000 Earth observation datasets with powerful cloud computing to show timely, accurate, high-resolution insights about the state of the world’s habitats and ecosystems—and how they’re changing over time.
Scientists, researchers, and developers have been using 
Earth Engine for more than a decade to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth’s surface. In 2022, over 90,000 users regularly used Earth Engine’s data analytics and computing for research and educational purposes. Multiple global conservation and restoration tools have also been built on the platform. For example, founded by Crowther Lab in Zurich and powered by Google Earth Engine and Google Cloud, Restor  allows anyone to analyze 
the restoration potential of any place on Earth. When you outline a given area on the Restor map, it will show you data on local biodiversity, the current and potential amount of solid carbon stored in the soil, land cover, soil pH, and annual rainfall. With this information, the platform connects practitioners, facilitates the exchange of information, and makes projects visible to potential funders and the public.In 2022, researchers addressed urban climate change inequities  using publicly available data from Earth Engine. 
This study used Earth Engine to combine medium-to-high-resolution satellite observations with census data to calculate the feasible area available for planting new trees in urban areas for over 200 areas in California.
 62 By quantifying this, 
they were able to provide estimates of several co-benefit  
of tree cover . 
To accelerate the innovation that we’ve seen from the scientific and NGO communities, we’re now bringing Google Earth Engine to public and private sector users.  In 2022, we expanded Google Earth Engine’s availability for commercial use by businesses and governments worldwide as an enterprise-grade service through Google Cloud.  With access to reliable, up-to-date insights on how our planet is changing, organizations will be better equipped  to move their sustainability efforts forward.
Google Earth
Our planet has seen rapid environmental change in the past half-century—more than at any other point in human history.
Timelapse  in Google Earth is a global, zoomable  
time-lapse video of the planet, providing a clearer picture 
of Earth’s dynamic change since 1984—not just problems,  but also solutions, as well as beautiful natural phenomena that unfold over decades—from irrigation systems emerging in the deserts of Egypt to volcanic eruptions, logging, and wildfires changing the landscape of California’s Lassen National Forest  and glaciers retreating  
in Sermersooq, Greenland  (see Figure 9). 
The imagery also captures how cities have adapted to combat climate change—like offshore wind farms in Middelgrunden, Denmark  and a large-scale solar

2023 Environmental Report  Data Commons
Sustainability data is fragmented across thousands of silos, 
in many formats and schemas, and across a multitude of databases. In 2017, we started the Data Commons  
project, which aggregates data from a wide range of sources into a unified database to make it more accessible and useful . Data Commons was developed by Google to 
organize sustainability data from hundreds of sources , 
such as the World Bank, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It makes this data available to researchers, journalists, policymakers, individuals, and other stakeholders around the globe.
Today, Data Commons is one of the world’s largest 
knowledge graphs on sustainability, including data about climate, health, food, crops, shelter, emissions, and more. Anyone can access, explore, and understand this data using Google Search or our free dashboards and visualization tools, and they can use our open and free APIs to build new tools based on this data. For enterprise customers, this data is available via Data Commons on the BigQuery Analytics Hub.
Data Commons is being used to monitor and address a 
variety of sustainability challenges, including climate change, natural disasters, water quality, and food security.
Climate change
Data Commons can ingest health data from the CDC and climate data from the IPCC, and combine them by aligning data on location, health conditions, or dates. A policymaker can then use Data Commons to compare these two datasets to identify outliers and understand how temperature changes may affect populations with pre-existing conditions .Natural disasters
Partnering with the John Doerr School of Climate at Stanford, Data Commons has helped Stanford create a climate disaster dashboard  to identify areas affected 
by wildfires, wet bulb temperatures, and other natural disasters exacerbated by climate change. The Data Commons team was able to take numerous climate models and model probabilities for future temperature ranges in specific areas.
Water quality
Data Commons is helping communities get a better understanding of water use, quality, and availability. For example, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras is working with Data Commons  to add India-based 
data on water quality.
Food security
Feeding America is a nationwide network of 200 member food banks serving tens of millions of people in need in the United States. Data from their annual Map the Meal Gap study is accessible in Feeding America Data Commons , so 
anyone can explore food security and how it intersects with variables like health, climate, and education. For example, it shows that counties that will be most affected by climate change are also already most affected by food scarcity . 
This data allows Feeding America to quickly identify U.S. locations where food insecurity is most exacerbated by other root causes of disparities and hardship.
Nonprofit TechSoup  used Data Commons to identify how 
climate change will impact food security needs in California. 
This allowed them to see that agricultural counties that will be most impacted by temperature changes are already at the highest levels of food insecurity. They can then map out specific food support sites to see which counties will need more civil society organizations helping with food insecurity.
Wildlife monitoring
In 2022, global search interest in     “wildlife ”   nearly 
tripled, 63 reaching a 15-year high. 64 We’re using our 
technology to support wildlife conservation efforts around the world. TerrAdapt  uses satellite monitoring technology 
powered by Google Earth Engine to project habitat conditions given future climate and land-use scenarios. TerrAdapt can help prioritize areas  for conservation 
actions—like habitat restoration, increasing protection status, and building wildlife crossings.
Google teamed up with the Commonwealth Scientific 
and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO—Australia’s national science agency) and the Kaggle data science community to protect coral reefs including Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the world’s biggest coral reef system. We developed a machine learning solution to analyze underwater images  of a species of starfish that feed 
on living coral. By detecting them more accurately and efficiently, scientists can now more easily monitor the reef and manage the impact of the starfish more effectively. In collaboration with CSIRO and other partners, we’re also applying AI to measure carbon sequestration  capacity of 
seagrass ecosystems.
Since 2017, Google has been a founding technology 
partner in Wildlife Insights —a collaboration between 
seven leading conservation organizations to streamline biodiversity monitoring  with the help of AI and to fill critical 
data gaps to inform data-driven decisions. This platform makes it easier for conservationists and scientists to collect and analyze data from remote cameras.We’re working with partners to leverage 
machine learning to monitor and protect wildlife habitats, such as coral reefs.

2023 Environmental Report  Investing in breakthrough innovation
We’re helping advance the next generation of audacious 
technologies to address sustainability challenges. Incubating breakthrough technologies is essential for  the transformative change needed to deliver deep emissions reductions at scale and to bend the curve  of climate change.
And at X, Alphabet’s “moonshot factory ,” our teams are 
developing cutting-edge technology that aims to solve 
problems for millions of people and change systems worldwide. Climate-related projects comprise more than half of X’s current moonshots, which include experiments in ocean health, carbon sequestration, clean energy, wildfire awareness, waste reduction, and sustainable agriculture. X is using what they’ve learned from a decade of climate projects to shape the work they’re doing now. 
Clean electricity
Tapestry  aims to unlock access to clean, reliable, and 
affordable electricity worldwide by providing greater insight into our increasingly dynamic and complex electricity system. As X’s moonshot for the electric grid , 
it’s creating a single virtualized view of the electricity system that can predict and simulate what might happen on the grid from nanoseconds to decades into the future. Insights from such computational models can lead to reduced energy consumption, lower emissions, and improved resilience to outages, as well as reduce interconnection queues, enabling more renewable energy capacity to be added to the grid.Ocean ecosystems
Tidal  is X’s moonshot to protect the ocean with 
technology systems while feeding humanity sustainably. Its underwater sensor system and machine perception tools are bringing visibility to our ocean ecosystems so we can better understand and protect them while sustainably harnessing the ocean to solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges—from food production to climate change. 
Tidal’s first product monitors fish and environmental 
conditions underwater to detect and interpret things like fish behaviors, which are helpful for feeding and health tracking, and predict outcomes such as growth trends over time—all of which can help fish farmers make better, more environmentally-friendly and cost-effective decisions about fish feeding, welfare, and health.
Autonomous driving
Waymo’s  mission is to make it safe and easy for people 
and things to get where they’re going. Waymo’s fleet of shared electric vehicles provides a fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix and San Francisco, connecting communities with the benefits of EVs. Waymo’s EV fleet is also matched with 100% renewable electricity.Sustainable food 
systems
Increasing agricultural productivity and sustainability 
is imperative to feed the planet’s growing population. Modern agriculture has a significant environmental impact, such as soil degradation and biodiversity loss due to weeds, pests, diseases, herbicide resistance, and excess chemical input waste. Mineral  uses robotics, 
AI, and computer vision to create a more sustainable food production system. It’s developing perception-powered solutions with partners across the agriculture value chain—from grocery retailers and enterprise farms to equipment manufacturers and crop protection companies—to develop a better understanding of the complex interactions of plants, their growing environment, and farm management practices.Mineral is using robotics, AI, and 
computer vision to create a more sustainable food production system.

2023 Environmental Report  Our  
ambition
Our work on sustainability started with our 
own operations, and we’ve worked hard to lead by example, with the ultimate goal of driving larger systems change. We set ambitious sustainability goals . We share the 
innovations we create and the lessons we learn with others, so we can help accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future.
We’re working to drive sustainability across our operations 
in four key ways: accelerating the transition to a net-zero carbon future, advancing water stewardship, building a circular economy, and protecting nature and biodiversity.Our 
operations
Google uses energy, natural resources, and products 
and services to build our workplaces, data centers, and consumer hardware products. At the end of 2022, we had offices and data centers in roughly 200 cities  and nearly 
60 countries  around the world. We also had two retail 
stores, both in New York City.
The products and services that our customers and users 
rely on—like Gmail, Google Cloud, Search, and YouTube—are powered by our data centers and networking infrastructure. At the end of 2022, we had 28 Google-owned and -operated data center campuses across 24 data center locations
 65 on four continents, as well as more 
than 30 Google Cloud regions . In addition to our Google-
owned and -operated data centers, we use additional third-party-operated data centers as well.
We work worldwide with suppliers that support 
our business and operations, including hardware manufacturing and indirect services. Through our Supplier Responsibility program , we collaborate with 
stakeholders across our supply chain to uphold our high standards for protecting workers and the environment.

The journey ahead
Our ambition
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change is unequivocal: climate change is an urgent threat to human well-being and the health of the planet.
 66 
While the last several years have seen significant progress in mobilizing the global community to take more ambitious climate action, the world isn’t on track to meet the targets established by the Paris Agreement to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C.
 67 
At Google, we’re working to accelerate the transition to a 
carbon-free future. We know that our responsibility begins with our own carbon footprint, which is why we’ve taken significant steps over the past two decades to minimize our own emissions. In 2021, we set our most ambitious goal yet: to achieve net-zero emissions  across all of our operations 
and value chain by 2030. To accomplish this, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. We’ve formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.
One of the key levers for reducing emissions from our 
operations is transitioning to clean energy. Energy use contributes to a significant share of our carbon footprint due to the electricity needs of our operations—in particular, our data centers. That’s why, in 2020, we set a goal to operate our data centers and office campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy  on every grid where we operate by 
2030 (24/7 CFE). We’ve been working hard to transition our operations and the electricity grids that serve us to cleaner sources of power, through a combination of clean energy procurement, technology innovation, and policy advocacy. And we expect our work to decarbonize electricity grids where we operate to contribute to decarbonization across our value chain as well.
Charting our path
Achieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals—what we call “moonshots.” We also know that our path to net-zero emissions won’t be easy or linear; it may require us to navigate significant uncertainty and deploy new systems and technologies across our business. Some of our plans will take years to deliver their full results, particularly where they involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. So as our business continues to evolve, we expect our emissions to rise before dropping towards our absolute emissions reduction target.
In our third decade of climate action , we recognize that 
we can’t achieve our goals alone. Transitioning to a carbon-
free future will require stronger government policies and partnerships with many other organizations, as well as new technologies and structural changes to the broader systems that serve our operations and value chain,  
such as electricity grids and hardware supply chains.   34
2023 Environmental Report  It will be especially critical for governments around the 
world to enact policies that drive rapid technological and economic transformations, including the full decarbonization of the global energy system. That’s why Google advocates for stronger clean energy and climate policies, and partners with many other organizations to accelerate clean energy and climate progress. We’ve played instrumental roles in setting up advocacy organizations, including the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) in the United States, the RE-Source Platform in Europe, and the Asia Clean Energy Coalition (ACEC). 
To learn more about our public policy and advocacy, 
including policy engagement, trade associations, memberships, and partnerships, see the Governance  
and Engagement  section.
Challenges to address
While we’re excited about our net-zero emissions journey, we recognize that we face many challenges. For example:
Growing energy needs
• As we work towards our absolute 50% emissions reduction target, our business is continuing to evolve to meet the needs of a rapidly digitalizing world, and to harness the opportunities presented by  AI technology.
• Our operations and value chain are global and involve a diverse range of industries, which means we must make progress within hard-to-abate sectors and carbon-intensive geographies, such as the Asia Pacific region. 
• We have a large number of different suppliers, both direct and indirect, each with climate programs that differ widely in maturity. In some cases, this limits our ability to successfully influence them, and to collect the data needed to accurately estimate our  Scope 3 emissions.
Availability of carbon-free energy
• There are often long lead times between our investments and resulting GHG reductions. For example, with new wind and solar projects, it can take years before projects that we contract are constructed and begin to generate clean electricity. 
• System-level decarbonization is proceeding more slowly than needed in many regions and sectors, and while we aim to accelerate these changes through our efforts and engagement, they aren’t within our control.
Use of carbon removals
• Because the carbon removals sector is in the earliest stage of development, costs are currently high, and there are limited volumes of removals available for purchase.
 68
As we move towards our net-zero goal, the scale of these challenges will only increase, along with the difficulty of additional progress. We believe that the urgency of climate change demands immediate action, and setting ambitious, near-term targets is a valuable way to focus our efforts and drive important progress across the energy systems and value chains in which we operate.

Our approach
Our core business involves using data to solve hard problems, and our unique strength is combining engineering skills with an innovative mindset and a global reach.
There are three main focus areas that make up our approach to our net-zero goal: reducing emissions across our operations and value chain, advancing carbon-free energy, and addressing our residual emissions with carbon removals (see Figure 10).

2023 Environmental Report  Measuring our carbon footprint
We began calculating our annual carbon footprint in 2006. 
Every year since 2009, we’ve publicly reported the results to CDP , a global organization that asks companies to 
disclose information on their GHG emissions performance and management.
In 2022, our total GHG emissions were approximately  
10.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO
2e), which represents our Scope 1, Scope 2  
(market-based), and Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, our total operational emissions were approximately 2.9 million tCO
2e, where operational emissions represent Scope 1 
and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions from business travel and employee commuting, including teleworking (see Figure 11).FIGURE 11

Scope 1 emissions represent 1% of our carbon 
footprint.  Our main sources of Scope 1 emissions include 
transportation (company vehicles and aircraft), fuel use from back-up generators, natural gas use, and refrigerant leakage in our data centers and offices.
Scope 2 emissions
Scope 2 (market-based) emissions represent 24% of our carbon footprint, mainly due to the electricity demands of our data centers. Scope 2 emissions are thus a key focus of our decarbonization efforts, given that we have more direct control over our data centers than many other parts of our value chain. For over a decade, we’ve procured clean energy to reduce the carbon emissions from our electricity use: our Scope 2 (location-based) emissions, which don’t take into account our renewable energy procurement through power purchase agreements (PPAs), represent 51% of our carbon footprint, demonstrating the dramatic emissions reductions that we’ve achieved through PPAs.
Scope 3 emissions
Our Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our value chain, such as our suppliers, use of our consumer hardware products, and business travel. The majority of these emissions come from upstream manufacturing of consumer hardware products, the production of capital goods we have purchased for use in our data centers, and data center construction. After accounting for the impact of renewable energy procurement through PPAs, Scope 3 emissions represent 75% of our carbon footprint.
For more information on our GHG emissions, see the 
Reporting approach and methodology  section and our 
Environmental data tables .   36
2023 Environmental Report  Reducing carbon emissions
We’re working to reduce our emissions across our 
operations and value chain. Key efforts include energy-efficient and low-carbon facilities, electrification, sustainable travel and commuting, and supplier engagement. 
Clean energy is also critical to reducing emissions across 
our value chain. Procuring carbon-free energy has a significant impact on reducing our Scope 2 emissions by eliminating emissions associated with our electricity use. In addition, a significant share of our Scope 3 emissions can be traced back to the electricity grids that power our suppliers and users, so accelerating the decarbonization of electricity grids is also key to our net-zero goal. For more information, see the Carbon-free energy  section.

This represents our operations and value chain, including consumer hardware products.Our emissions reduction 
goal
In 2022, our total GHG emissions were approximately 
10.2 million tCO2e. We revised our Scope 3 methodology 
to calculate upstream emissions related to consumer hardware manufacturing by moving away from using a spend-based methodology to a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based methodology. 
We also made improvements to the quality of data used 
to estimate our emissions associated with manufacturing our data center hardware, as well as the LCAs and LCA emission factors used to calculate emissions related to data center construction. 
These changes are reflected in our reported Scope 
3 emissions for fiscal year 2022, but not for the prior years. Had we not made these changes, we estimate that our reported Scope 3 emissions would have been approximately 18% higher, remaining relatively flat when compared to the prior year (see Figure 12).
Our Scope 2 (market-based) emissions increased by 
37%, primarily due to increased data center electricity consumption and a lack of full regional coverage of renewable energy procurement in the United States  and Asia Pacific regions.In 2022, we reported Scope 2 (location-based) emissions of 8.0 million tCO
2e, which doesn’t take into account our 
renewable energy procurement, and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions of 2.5 million tCO
2e. This means that 
through our PPAs, in 2022, we achieved a 69% reduction in our emissions from our electricity use (see Figure 17).
Since 2011, our carbon intensity per unit of revenue has 
decreased by 76% while our business grew significantly over the same period.
 69 We continue working to lower  
the correlation between our business growth and our GHG emissions.

We pursue a set of integrated strategies to reduce 
the carbon footprint of our facilities, including energy efficiency, building and fleet electrification, on-site generation of clean energy, and carbon-free energy procurement. Reducing waste is another strategy,  which is covered in the Circular economy  section.
When designing our data centers and offices, we consider options to reduce their carbon impacts, such as the incorporation of low-GHG materials and adaptive reuse of existing buildings. For example, in Sunnyvale, California, we’re building our first ground-up mass timber building , which is projected to have 96% fewer embodied carbon emissions than an equivalent steel and concrete structure, factoring in sequestration.

Preventing refrigerants from leaking and finding low-global warming potential (GWP) alternatives is critical for reducing global emissions.
 71 We’re taking steps to more 
accurately measure refrigerant leak rates and working to develop new technology solutions that can prevent emissions from these leaks. For example, at our data centers, we’re developing and deploying cooling solutions that include natural, low-GWP refrigerants .
Google is a founding member of the iMasons Climate Accord , an industry coalition working to reduce GHG 
emissions across the technical infrastructure systems that support the digital economy. As a part of this effort, we’re collaborating with industry peers to highlight the importance of low-GHG construction materials, such as greener concrete , and to accelerate progress in the 
development and deployment of these materials.
In 2022, we filed a patent for using machine 
learning technology to improve our ability to prevent emissions from refrigerant leaks.
Data centers
Google’s data centers are the engine of our company, powering products like Gmail, Google Cloud, Search, and YouTube for billions of people around the world. We’ve worked to make Google’s data centers some of the most efficient in the world, improving their environmental performance even as demand for our products has risen. We’ve done this by designing, building, and operating each one to maximize efficient use of energy, water, 
and ma
terials.
Our long-standing data center efficiency  efforts are 
important because our data centers represent the vast majority of our direct electricity use. To reduce their energy use, we strive to build the world’s most energy-efficient computing network, outfitting each data center with high-performance servers that we’ve custom-designed to use as little energy as possible. For example, our tensor processing unit v4 has enabled us to train machine learning algorithms with industry-leading efficiency , resulting in significant 
emissions reductions compared to business as usual.
 72 
We also install smart temperature and lighting controls , 
redesign how power is distributed to reduce energy loss, and employ advanced cooling techniques,  including 
energy-efficient evaporative cooling.
At some sites, we also recapture heat generated by our 
servers and use it to heat our data center office spaces and other on-site facilities. We continue to assess opportunities

Heat recovery is also a key part of our office development strategy, as well as one of the main levers to help us electrify—because reusing heat often requires less energy than creating new heat.
Our efforts have paid off. On average, a Google-owned 
and -operated data center is more than 1.5 times as energy efficient  as a typical enterprise data center
 74 and, 
compared with five years ago, we now deliver approximately three times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power.
 75 In 2022, the average annual 
power usage effectiveness (PUE) 76 for our global fleet of 
data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55
 77—meaning that Google data centers use about 5.5 
times less overhead energy for every unit of IT equipment energy. Since 2012, our average annual fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12 (see Figure 13).
In 2022, we maintained our ISO 50001 certification for all 
Google-owned and -operated data centers in Europe that met our operational threshold for power usage. We were the first major internet company to achieve a multi-site energy management system certification to ISO 50001, which we first obtained in 2013.

demand has gone up, the energy needed to power this 
technology has increased at a much slower rate than many forecasts predicted. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large 
margins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1,000x. For more information, see the AI for sustainability  section.

2023 Environmental Report  Electrification at our offices
Electrification—which helps enable transitioning away 
from fossil fuels—is an essential first step toward decarbonizing our operations, followed by 24/7 CFE procurement. We’re exploring opportunities to electrify our facilities , from retrofitting existing building 
systems, to including electrification standards for new development, to working with landlords on electrification-friendly leases for buildings we don’t own.
We’ve been piloting technologies to enable building 
electrification since 2010. For example, our first all-electric office—1842 North Shoreline in Mountain View, California—has been in operation for over a decade. Many of these pilots led us to confidently implement new technology in our large development projects. In 2022, we advanced a comprehensive plan to electrify systems across our building portfolio. 
More recently, in 2022, we opened Bay View—an all-
electric campus with an innovative geothermal installation and the largest electric kitchen in our global portfolio. Learn more in our Bay View spotlight . 
We’re also working to eliminate use of natural gas by designing all-electric kitchens at our offices, including in the Bay Area, Europe, and Latin America.

and commuting
Our transportation team plans, implements, and operates 
sustainable commuting options that help Googlers get to work by riding shuttles, carpooling, taking public transit, biking, or walking. 
We have a growing number of electric vehicles  in 
our corporate fleet, and the majority of our global fuel 
consumption from non-electric vehicles is renewable diesel. We strive to provide electric vehicle charging stations for 10% of the total parking spaces at our Bay Area headquarters, and we continue to work toward this design standard for new development projects. 
To date, we’ve installed more than 5,000 electric vehicle 
charging ports at our offices. We estimate that employee EV commuting in the United States and Canada prevented roughly 12,000 tCO
2e emissions in 2022. 80 
Many campuses offer commuter shuttles  to reduce 
individual vehicle trips. In 2022, we launched an  expansion of our all-electric buses for the Bay Area and are introducing these throughout 2023 to replace our existing fleet. For 2022, our shuttle buses in the Bay Area produced savings of more than 10,000 tCO
2e emissions—
the equivalent of avoiding more than 41 million vehicle km (25 million vehicle miles) or taking on average more than 2,000 cars off the road for a year.

Supplier engagement
We work with many suppliers that are committed to 
sustainability, and we’re partnering with them to develop decarbonization roadmaps and build essential data infrastructure to accurately quantify emissions and reductions across the value chain.
We engage with our suppliers—including hardware 
manufacturing and indirect services suppliers—to help reduce their energy consumption and GHG emissions, as stated in our Supplier Code of Conduct , which all 
suppliers are required to sign. We assess suppliers’ practices to report, manage, and reduce their emissions and incorporate this into our supplier scorecard.
Reporting  
environmental data
We expect all our suppliers to report environmental data, 
and we encourage them to respond to CDP’s Climate Change survey. In 2022, we invited 222 suppliers to participate, and at least 90% of our hardware suppliers, by spend, provided data. Our supplier data is used to help set goals and priorities for our sustainability program and we continue to refine our data quality and methodology for calculating the carbon footprint associated with the manufacturing of our hardware products throughout their life cycle.
In 2022, in addition to our CDP supply chain disclosure 
requests, we engaged with suppliers directly to drive improved data and accounting, including increased completeness and accuracy for their Scope 1, 2, and  3 emissions.
Developing roadmaps to 
reduce emissions
Since setting our net-zero emissions goal, we’ve engaged 
our key suppliers to develop roadmaps to reduce emissions across our supply chain. During Google’s 2022 Supplier Sustainability Summit, we communicated the expectation for suppliers to publicly set targets to reduce GHG emissions. We provide in-depth training for key suppliers on setting ambitious GHG reduction and renewable electricity targets. For suppliers that completed our CDP supply chain survey, 75% reported having GHG emissions reduction targets, and of those suppliers, 36% reported that their target is science-based. We aim to accelerate our suppliers’ GHG emissions reductions through further integration of climate performance into key procurement tools and the development of new mechanisms to drive deep supplier decarbonization.   41
2023 Environmental Report  Advancing carbon-free energy
Our primary approach for reducing our Scope 2 emissions 
is through the procurement of carbon-free energy. 83 Since 
2017, we’ve matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our global operations with purchases of renewable energy on an annual basis.
 84 
However, because of differences in the availability of renewable energy sources like solar and wind across the regions where we operate—and because of the variable supply of these resources—we still need to rely on carbon-emitting energy sources that power local grids (see Figure 15). That’s why, in 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030, aiming to procure clean energy to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day, within every grid where we operate. Achieving this will also increase the impact of our clean energy procurement on the decarbonization of the grids that serve us.
 85We’re working to achieve 24/7 CFE through three main initiatives: purchasing carbon-free energy , accelerating 
new and improved technologies , and transforming the 
energy system  through partnerships and advocacy.
FIGURE 15

Achieving 24/7 CFE is far more complex and technically 
challenging than annually matching our energy use with renewable energy purchases. No company of our size  has achieved 24/7 CFE before, and there’s no playbook  for making it happen. But we see our efforts as part of a bigger picture, and we’ve set this ambitious goal to help scale new, global solutions. We’re excited to see others—like the U.S. federal government —set similar goals as well.Renewable energy 
procurement
We buy electricity directly from new wind and solar farms 
via long-term PPAs on the grids where we operate, and we also buy renewable power through utilities via renewable energy purchasing models that we helped create.
From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements 
totaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity—the equivalent of more than  31 million solar panels. Through these agreements, we estimate we’ll spend approximately $10 billion to purchase clean energy through 2040.
 86 
In 2022, we signed contracts for approximately 2.8 GW of clean energy capacity—more than in any prior year. This included two new projects in the U.K. and Spain, our first in each country, that will help our Cloud regions and offices move closer to 24/7 CFE.

2023 Environmental Report  In 2022, we also saw projects we’d contracted over the 
past few years becoming operational in Belgium, Chile, Denmark, and Finland—providing important clean energy 
resources  to the grids where we operate, and bringing us 
closer to 24/7 CFE:
 • Belgium:  At our facility in St. Ghislain, Belgium, we 
installed the first-ever battery-based backup power system for a data center. 
 • Chile:  In 2019, Google signed a contract with AES 
Chile to build 23 new wind turbines in Chile’s Biobío region. The project is part of a hybrid wind and solar portfolio that adds 125 MW of clean energy generation capacity. With this wind farm now operational, our data center in Chile operated at 90% CFE in 2022.
 • Denmark:  The Rødby Fjord solar project began adding 
carbon-free energy to the grid that powers our data center in Fredericia, Denmark. In total, this project adds 54.5 MW of generation capacity to the more than 100 MW of existing operational solar resources  in Denmark. • Finland: Google signed a contract with Ilmatar  for approximately 60% of the 211 MW generation capacity Piiparinmäki, Finland’s largest wind farm, which was completed in November 2021. Google’s early agreement to buy the output of this project was critical to the wind farm getting built, and in 2022 it became fully operational and began feeding into  the grid that powers our Hamina data center. 
In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of the annual electricity consumption of our global operations with renewable energy purchases. As of the end of 2022, we’ve now achieved six consecutive years   
of 100% renewable energy matching on an annual basis (see Figure 16).

DETAILS
Year set: 2020    |    Base year: N/A    |    Target year: 2030
Scope: Regional % carbon-free energy scores 89,  averaged across Google’s global portfolio of data centers  
and offices for 2022. This represents the clean energy procured to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day, within every grid where we operate. In 2022, we expanded our reporting from only Google-owned and -operated data centers to also incorporate offices and third-party data centers.
24/7 CFE progress
We believe in transparency as a guiding principle, so this year, we’re expanding our carbon-free energy reporting. For the first time, we’re including CFE scores for both Google-owned and -operated data centers and third-party facilities  where Google leases space and 
data processing capacity to support our services. As a result, there are new grid regions
 90 included in this year’s 
reporting. We’re also including a separate CFE score of  the global average for our offices.
Data centers
In 2022, we achieved approximately 64%  round-the-clock 
carbon-free energy across all of our data center sites, inclusive of those operated by third parties. Our 2022 CFE represents a 2% change from 2021 (66% CFE), as a result of updating our metric this year to include third-party operated facilities. Without this change in methodology, CFE for Google-owned and -operated data centers would have remained relatively flat year-over-year.
Our total electricity load across all data center facilities 
increased by roughly 3 TWh (18%) from 2021 to 2022, while our contracted CFE
 91 increased by roughly 2 TWh (17%). 
Despite this significant expansion of carbon-free energy supply, the percentage of our energy use that came from carbon-free sources remained relatively flat because of the significant growth in our total electricity load.
Beyond the challenge of growing our CFE  
procurement  to keep up with our growing power 
demand, last year we also faced headwinds that made it more challenging to purchase CFE—including continued disruptions to renewable energy supply chains, delays for interconnecting new utility-scale projects, and increased demand for clean energy projects. Adding to these difficulties, load growth continued in regions where CFE contracting is especially difficult given local market dynamics and resource availability constraints (such as the PJM [Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland] grid region in the eastern United States and certain Asia Pacific  grid regions).
Despite these significant headwinds, we’re proud of the 
progress we were able to make across many of our data center facilities. Seven of our 41 grid regions achieved 
at lea
st 90% CFE , and 13 achieved at least 85% CFE  
(see Figure 18). These 13 grid regions span North America, 
Lati
n America, and Europe. 
While load grew significantly within the central United States, our CFE procurement in this region kept pace—keeping the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool among our highest-scoring grid regions. We increased our contracted CFE in the  U.K., Finland, and Germany.
To see more data regarding CFE by region, see the 
Environmental data table . 
Offices
For our offices, which represent a small portion of our global CFE score, we achieved approximately 56%  round-
the-clock carbon-free energy. 
CFE for commercial real estate faces different challenges, 
including variability in building characteristics, work patterns, and geographic locations with a broad range of electricity grid carbon intensities. In addition to helping us achieve our own climate goals, pursuing CFE for our offices can help expand clean energy options in the cities we call home.

2023 Environmental Report  Innovative purchasing 
models
Our early adoption and long-term support of clean energy 
projects has coincided with the rapid growth of the industry and remarkable declines in the cost of solar and wind power.
 92 Along the way, we’ve pioneered innovative 
new contracting models and industry partnerships to help accelerate the adoption of corporate clean energy practices and make clean energy more accessible to a wider range of corporate buyers.
New contracting approaches
In 2022, we published a white paper outlining details of the CFE Manager model , a new approach to clean energy 
procurement that can help a wide range of energy buyers streamline their clean energy purchasing. We share three case studies where Google recently signed CFE Manager agreements—in Virginia, Germany, and California—and discuss some contractual terms and issues that buyers pursuing these agreements should consider.
In addition to the CFE manager model, in 2022 we piloted 
a new approach to clean energy requests for proposals that can reduce the time to negotiate and execute a clean energy PPA by up to 80%. We’re hopeful this new approach will give clean energy buyers and sellers useful new options for negotiating PPAs, and enable all organizations that want to decarbonize their electricity use to join us on the journey to 24/7 CFE.
Helping local communities
Finally, we believe that our clean energy procurement shouldn’t only benefit the climate, but also the local communities that host our facilities—in particular, historically underserved communities  that haven’t 
typically benefited from the clean energy transition. Three years ago, we started a journey to better understand how we can help lower barriers to an equitable clean energy transition, culminating in two additions to our clean energy procurement approach that respond to those challenges. 
The first program extends clean energy’s financial 
benefits to local communities. Through a first-of-its-kind partnership with EDPR NA Distributed Generation , 
we’ll create a 500 MW community-based solar portfolio, adding clean energy to the regional U.S. PJM power grid and providing Google with Renewable Energy Credits that contribute to 24/7 CFE . At least 10% of the portfolio’s 
revenues will be redirected annually for up to 15 years as utility bill credits to more than 25,000 households facing a high energy burden. 
The second program aims to spur long-term investments 
to improve housing infrastructure. Through a partnership with Sol Systems , we’re providing funding to three rural 
electric cooperatives and one regional organization with deep roots in North Carolina and South Carolina to undertake critical home pre-weatherization and safety upgrades for low- and moderate-income households. Alongside this investment, the partnership will deliver new solar energy and battery storage resources, moving us closer to 24/7 CFE and bringing clean energy to one of the most challenging grids to decarbonize. 
Both of these programs are based on discussions with  
U.S. government officials, national NGOs, and policy advocates about challenges to an equitable energy transition in their communities. We’ll continue to build on these programs to extend the benefits of our investments to underserved communities.Accelerating new and 
improved technologies
Wind and solar power have played a critical role in 
enabling Google’s clean energy progress, but meeting 24/7 CFE—and maximizing our contribution to global decarbonization—will require expanding our technology toolkit. In 2022, we continued to work on a wide range  of projects to demonstrate, scale, and maximize the climate impact of carbon-free energy technologies,  using Google’s engineering capabilities and purchasing demand to accelerate the commercialization of new  clean energy technologies:
 • Optimizing generation from existing CFE technologies: To reduce the carbon footprint of  
our new Bay View and Charleston East campuses, we designed and installed “ dragonscale ,” a new solar 
roofing technology that helps us power our facilities through on-site generation. Learn more in our  Bay View spotlight .
 • Managing energy demand across our global operations: We developed a “carbon-intelligent computing platform” that optimizes the timing and location of computing tasks based on local CFE availability. This allows us to shift some of our data centers’ computing tasks to the times of day when local solar and wind power are most plentiful, and  to shift tasks geographically  across data centers so 
that we can do more computing in regions where  CFE is abundant.
 • Accelerating next generation energy sources:  
In 2021, we signed the first corporate agreement to develop a next-generation geothermal  power project, 
and in 2022, we installed the first-ever battery-based backup  power system for a data center at our 
facility in St. Ghislain, Belgium. This application will enable Google to optimize the carbon footprint of backup power, buying local, low-carbon power for backup when available rather than relying on diesel generators.
 • Improving energy data and clean energy tracking: Google is driving the development of advanced methods for tracking clean energy, including time-based energy attribute certificates . We’re also working 
to improve the quality, consistency, and granularity of grid electricity data through active collaborations with organizations including EnergyTag, Electricity Maps, FlexiDAO, and more.We’re deploying machine learning solutions to optimize wind power forecasting  and project economics .

2023 Environmental Report  Transforming the 
energy system through partnerships and advocacy
Global search interest in    “sustainable energy ”   
reached an all-time high in March 2022. 93 Our 24/7 CFE 
efforts are designed to maximize our contribution to the 
decarbonization of power grids worldwide. That’s why we’re supporting others to join us on the journey to 24/7 CFE, by sharing insights and lessons we’re learning and new approaches we’re developing. 
One such example is the United Nations 24/7 Carbon-
free Energy Compact , which we helped launch with 
Sustainable Energy for All and other partners in 2021. The Compact is a global community dedicated to building the technologies, policies, tools, ideas, and advocacy needed to accelerate the decarbonization of electricity grids. In Europe, we work with the European 24/7 CFE Hub, a collaboration with Eurelectric to create a platform where energy buyers, suppliers, and policy makers can meet to learn more about 24/7 CFE and receive technical training and implementation guidance.
Public policy and advocacy
In addition to corporate action, we recognize that the clean energy transition also requires strong actions from governments, and we call for ambitious public policies aimed at decarbonizing electricity grids worldwide. In 2022, we published a first-of-its-kind policy roadmap sharing our recommendations for energy policy and market reforms to accelerate electricity decarbonization, informed by our experiences as a large energy user and clean energy buyer around the world. As we advance toward our goal of 24/7 CFE, we’re committed to working with others and advocating for clean energy policies that can enable 24/7 CFE for all energy consumers by decarbonizing electricity grids at the scale and pace required to meet the world’s climate challenge.
We also recognize that accurate, comprehensive, and 
actionable corporate GHG inventories are essential to help companies understand their carbon footprints and determine how to mitigate emissions. That’s why we recently submitted comments  in response to an open 
survey  on the future of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
(GHGP). Updating the GHGP will drive continued improvements in the accuracy of companies’ GHG inventories, providing useful information that enables them to make decisions and take actions that drive real, measurable GHG reductions.
For more information on our public policy and advocacy, 
see the Governance and engagement section.
CFE investments
Google works with suppliers around the world. The electricity grids in many countries where our suppliers operate lack sufficient carbon-free energy capacity to support rapidly growing demand, and may even face energy shortages that affect not just manufacturing but also the communities and livelihoods of the people in these regions. Our long-term vision is that all of our suppliers—for hardware manufacturing, transport, logistics, and indirect services—and their communities have access to reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free energy. And we’ll get there only through significant global investment in new wind, solar, and other clean energy capacity, as well as more robust grid systems.In addition to purchasing renewable energy for our own operations, we also make targeted investments in renewable energy. Investment in renewable capacity is a scalable approach to creating system-level change by driving grid decarbonization and enabling greater access to carbon-free energy. This is especially significant in markets where credible procurement mechanisms for clean energy are nascent or nonexistent. We aim to invest in clean energy projects that reduce emissions and serve manufacturing operations across our supply chain.
Google aims to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free 
energy through investments in our key manufacturing regions by 2030. In 2022, we signed agreements to invest approximately $350 million to support 0.5 GW of renewable energy projects towards this 5 GW total. This builds on our long-standing track record in this space; From 2010 to 2022, we entered into agreements to invest nearly $2.9 billion in renewable energy projects with an expected combined generation capacity of approximately 4.2 GW.
Towards our 5 GW goal, Google’s investments will be 
targeted to support bringing additional carbon-free energy capacity online in key manufacturing regions around the globe, including in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Such projects may reduce Google’s carbon footprint directly, may reduce a Google supplier’s carbon footprint, or may simply help decarbonize the local grid.  
Asia Pacific—a critical region for our suppliers—is one of 
the most challenging regions for contracting or investing in carbon-free energy projects.
 94 Making carbon-free 
energy investments in key Asia Pacific regions is, and will continue to be, an area of deep focus for Google moving forward. Google has identified several promising carbon-free energy investment opportunities in the region, all of which are in various stages of due diligence.CFE for supplier operations
More of our suppliers are using renewable energy. Of the suppliers invited to report to Google via CDP Supply Chain, 26% (58 suppliers) said they have renewable energy targets, and 12% (26 suppliers) have targets that are part of the RE100  initiative. To accelerate decarbonization of 
our supply chain, we’re engaging with our key suppliers to encourage them to commit to procuring 100% renewable energy for their operations.  
Our work in increasing supplier access to renewable 
energy is intentionally inclusive. We aim for our investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency to drive better manufacturing across Google’s supply chain and—importantly—to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing for people and communities around the world. 
Looking ahead, we’re working to:
• Close our first renewable energy investment deal in a 
key Asia Pacific manufacturing region, working toward our broader goal to enable 5 GW of new carbon-free energy in key regions by 2030.
• Increase access to cost-effective renewable energy at scale for supply chain partners in key manufacturing regions through direct supplier and public policy engagements.
• Participate in advocacy efforts related to supply chain renewable energy and carbon mitigation, working collaboratively with industry-leading institutions to research solutions and share best practices.   47
2023 Environmental Report  Managing residual emissions
We aim to avoid or reduce GHG emissions to reach our 
absolute emissions reduction target, but there are some emissions that will remain difficult to abate. We’re taking multiple approaches to address these residual emissions and are aiming to play an important role in advancing the development and deployment of nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions.
As we continue to build out these efforts, we’ll share 
an annual disclosure of our use of carbon credits and removals on our path to net-zero emissions. This will include information about our criteria, approach, and portfolio, including details on project purchases and any relevant certifications.
2022 HIGHLIGHT
We contributed $200 million to 
Frontier, an advanced market commitment that’s accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies, as one of five companies that made a $925 million total pledge.
Carbon removal 
solutions
While permanent carbon removal solutions aren’t yet 
economically viable or deployed at scale, the IPCC stated in 2022 that “the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to counterbalance hard-to-abate residual emissions is unavoidable if net-zero emissions are to be achieved.”
 95 That’s why we’re supporting the development 
and commercialization of emerging carbon removal technologies, as well as the development of initiatives to ensure the integrity and climate impact of CDR solutions. 
Starting in 2022, we began funding the development of 
nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions. At the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2022, Google joined the First Movers Coalition . As a 
champion for the Carbon Dioxide Removal sector, Google committed to contract for durable and scalable net carbon dioxide removal to be achieved by the end of 2030.
In 2022, we contributed $200 million towards a $925 million 
total pledge to Frontier , an advanced market commitment 
that’s accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies by guaranteeing future demand. As a founding member of Frontier, we’re signing our first offtake deals in 2023, with removals expected to be delivered starting in 2024. Already, Frontier has announced its first deal, a partnership with the start-up Charm Industrial to remove 112,000 tons of CO
2 between 2024 and 2030.
Strengthening carbon 
markets
While CDR technologies are being proven and scaled over 
the short to medium term, we believe that carbon credits can play a valuable role in keeping the world on track for a 1.5ºC future. Since 2007, we’ve supported the capture and destruction of highly potent greenhouse gasses through the procurement of high-quality carbon credits .
Since we began procuring high-quality carbon credits, we’ve learned a lot from our experience —including the 
importance of developing and following guiding principles related to credit quality, implementing robust validation processes, and establishing long-term partnerships with project owners and developers. We’re now working to help strengthen carbon credit markets through engagement with other companies and stakeholders in the scientific, academic, and NGO communities. We’re partnering on improving measurement, reporting, and verification and developing tools to support robust, well-functioning markets. For example, Google.org has contributed more than $6 million to efforts to strengthen carbon markets, digitize their infrastructure, and set standards for high-quality carbon credits. 
As we move forward on our path to net-zero emissions, 
we’ll continue to evolve our approach to counterbalancing our residual emissions. 
 Google and clean-energy startup Fervo signed the world’s first corporate agreement to develop a next-generation geothermal power project.   48
2023 Environmental Report  The journey ahead
As we move forward on our journey to reduce our 
emissions, we’ll continue to focus both on our own footprint and on the larger systems that serve us—from electricity grids to transportation networks to materials supply chains. 
We’ve made great progress in procuring clean energy,  
but we still have a long way to go to meet our 2030  net-zero target. We recognize we’ll face many challenges along the way, for example:
 • Meeting our growing energy needs
 • Availability of carbon-free energy
 • Cost and limited volumes of carbon removals
For more details, see the Challenges to address  section above.
We also know we can’t get there alone. To scale our  
work, we’ve created tools, white papers, and case studies to help others adopt some of the approaches that have worked for us.
 • The CFE manager: A new model for driving decarbonization impact
 • Time-based energy attribute certificatesThe clean energy transition also requires strong actions from governments, and we call for ambitious public policies aimed at decarbonizing electricity grids worldwide.
 • Policy recommendations to accelerate  
carbon-free energy
Ultimately, achieving a carbon-free future for all requires rapid and far-reaching transformations to these systems, and as we grow our efforts towards net-zero emissions for our own footprint, we’ll prioritize actions where we can make unique contributions and maximize our impact on larger systems change.

The journey ahead
Our ambition
The world is facing an unprecedented water crisis, with global freshwater demand predicted to exceed supply by 40% by 2030.
 96 Climate change has exacerbated 
water stress, causing destabilizing droughts and unpredictable flooding around the world. 
In 2021, we announced our commitment to water 
stewardship : we aim to replenish 120% of the freshwater 97 
volume we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers by 2030, and help restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the communities where we operate. This ambition is bold, particularly when considering both the growth of our business and the challenges and complexities of global water stewardship work. Understanding the most impactful intervention requires local context, and water replenishment is still a maturing field with some limitations to identifying ready-to-implement project opportunities. 
We’re working to achieve this replenishment target 
through continued and scaled investments in projects that are located within the watersheds we rely on to provide water to our data centers and offices. We work with external partners to implement these projects, which deliver both volumetric water benefits and improve other locally relevant aspects of watershed health, such as water quality, community water access, and biodiversity. Our approach
At Google, we use water to help cool our data centers, and in our offices around the world. Water is also used throughout our value chain, in the manufacturing of both consumer hardware products and data center equipment.
We work to drive water efficiency and reuse across our 
global operations, from reducing our potable water use intensity at our San Francisco Bay Area headquarters to using seawater for cooling at our data center in Hamina, Finland.
Our water stewardship strategy  is centered on 
assessing and addressing water-related risks to our 
business and the opportunities we have to not just mitigate those risks, but also create solutions that can be scaled beyond our own corporate footprint. We also strive to partner with others to address this shared challenge.
When it comes to addressing shared water challenges, 
technology can be a useful tool to bring visibility to these challenges to enable smarter, more informed decision-making. We’re building tools to make water data and technology universally accessible, enabling effective water stewardship and improving the resilience of watersheds and ecosystems.   50
2023 Environmental Report  Advancing responsible water use
We’re committed to advancing and enhancing our water 
management practices across our operational footprint  
at Google’s offices and data centers around the world.  
We continue to collaborate, test, and share our learnings 
on responsible water use. This includes accelerating water reuse practices across our offices and data centers, and tailoring site-specific solutions  based on facility types, 
locations, and local water contexts.
In 2022, total water consumption at our data centers and 
offices was 5.6 billion gallons—the equivalent of what it takes to irrigate 37 golf courses annually, on average, in the southwestern United States.
 98 Wherever feasible, we try to use non-potable sources of freshwater and alternatives to freshwater.
As part of our commitment to using water responsibly, we 
evaluate and take into account local water stress when deciding where to locate our facilities, how to design them, and how to operate them—from water systems in our offices to cooling systems in our data centers. That’s why, in 2022, 82%  of our freshwater withdrawals came 
from regions with low water stress.
 99 In locations facing 
water stress, we’re actively exploring new partnerships and opportunities to improve overall watershed health and resilience. By working to replenish more than we consume, we’re striving to help address the water scarcity gap.

Data centers
To minimize the net-climate impact at each of our data center campuses, both today and in the future, we consult with local experts and make regionally appropriate cooling technology decisions that balance the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water. 
In many places, water is the most efficient means of 
cooling. When used responsibly, water cooling can play an important role in reducing emissions. We’ve found that our water-cooled data centers use about 10% less energy and emit roughly 10% less carbon emissions than our air-cooled data centers.
 100
At our data centers, we aim to implement technologies and solutions that reduce freshwater consumption when feasible, and use alternative sources such as reclaimed wastewater and even seawater. We withdraw reclaimed or non-potable water at 25% of our data center campuses. Due to these solutions, 23% of our total data center water withdrawal (excluding seawater) is reclaimed wastewater and other non-potable water. For example, at our data center in Douglas County, Georgia, we redirect local sewer water that would otherwise be discharged in the Chattahoochee River and use it to cool our facility. Additionally, our data center in Hamina, Finland, uses seawater for cooling rather than withdrawing freshwater. Additionally, at our data center in Eemshaven, the Netherlands, we partnered with the community to bring in industrial canal water to cool our data center, leaving potable water for other uses. 
In 2022, we described our climate-conscious data 
center cooling strategy , in which we both championed 
responsible water use and explained how this work complements our efforts to run on 24/7 CFE on every grid where we operate by 2030. In this blog, we published our 2021 annual water metrics for our U.S. data center locations, and committed to sharing annual water metrics for additional global locations beginning with this report.  See our Environmental data tables  for our 2022 water 
data—disclosed both globally and by data center location.
These colorful pipes in our Douglas County, Georgia data center send and receive water for cooling our facility.   51
2023 Environmental Report  Offices
Around the world, our offices use water for a variety 
of needs including preparing food, cleaning and 
hygiene, irrigating campus landscapes, and keeping our 
workspaces cool. We take a variety of approaches to 
manage water responsibly and drive responsible water 
use in our real estate operations through increased 
efficiency and by sourcing water from non-potable 
supplies.
One of the main ways we conserve water in Google 
workplaces is by adopting design standards  aligned 
with leading third-party certifications, including LEED 
and the LBC. Our building design requirements for new 
construction include the incorporation of water-efficient 
fixtures, such as faucets, toilets, and irrigation systems. 
These design standards also address replacing old fixtures 
with highly efficient ones in any space we move into, and 
installing water meters with automatic leak detection. In 
multiple offices around the world, we’ve achieved Alliance 
for Water Stewardship certification, a leading third-party 
standard that helps us develop best-in-class, regional 
strategies for responsible water use, and to engage with 
local partners on watershed health projects.
Beyond these standards, we drive water stewardship in our 
workplaces by developing innovative solutions  that strive 
to be replicable and scalable. For example, our new Bay 
View campus , which opened  in 2022, is on track to be the 
largest development project in the world to achieve Water 
Petal certification from the LBC, with an on-site stormwater 
and wastewater treatment system that can serve as a 
model for others. Learn more in our Bay View spotlight .Supply chain
Addressing water challenges requires accurate water 
use data throughout our supply chain. By monitoring 
this data, we can focus our water stewardship efforts 
on supplier facilities with the greatest opportunities for 
improved management. To measure water use and assess 
water risk in our value chain, we ask suppliers to disclose 
water-related data  via the CDP supply chain platform 
and complete and disclose water risk assessments of their 
direct operations and value chain.
In 2022, 177 of the 186 suppliers (95%) that were invited 
to participate in the Water Security portion of the CDP 
Supply Chain survey responded. This reporting includes 
data on water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge—
all water withdrawn from all sources (e.g., surface water, 
groundwater, rainwater, municipal water supply, and 
trucked water), the portion of water permanently lost in the 
withdrawal (e.g., evaporated or incorporated into products 
from cooling, irrigation, and production processes), and the 
water effluents discharged to all locations (e.g., subsurface 
and surface waters, sewers, and groundwater).
To learn more about how we assess and manage our water-
related risks, see the Governance and engagement  section.

2023 Environmental Report  Benefiting watersheds and 
communities
Many watersheds around the world are degrading in health, 
with each location facing unique challenges. Improving watershed and ecosystem health is a critical part of our strategy, which allows us to focus on solutions to shared water challenges that are impacting watersheds the most, whether they’re related to water quantity and availability, water quality, ecosystem and habitat degradation, loss of biodiversity, or community access to water.
In addition to focusing on responsible water use within our 
operations, we aim to replenish 20% more freshwater than we consume each year, on a global average basis. We’ll focus our replenishment efforts in watersheds that Google offices and data centers rely on. The additional volume of water we replenish at each location will vary depending on the local conditions, and we’ll prioritize replenishment projects in water-scarce regions to help ensure that we’re positively impacting the areas that need it most.
As of the end of 2022, the first full year since we launched 
this strategy and target, our contracted watershed projects have replenished 271 million gallons of water
 102—
equivalent to more than 400 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This represents 6% of our 2022 freshwater consumption. As of the end of 2022, we estimate that these 38 replenishment projects had the capacity to replenish over 1.3 billion gallons of water annually once fully implemented.Water replenishment 
projects
In support of our water stewardship strategy, we’ve made 
progress in helping to restore and improve the quality of water and health of ecosystems in the watersheds we rely on. We’ve intentionally designed our strategy to prioritize a range of watershed health issues, enabling us to invest in a diverse set of impactful watershed health projects that are appropriate for each local context.
We conduct regular water risk assessments of our global 
assets to identify priority basins. Within each priority basin, we assess local water context and shared water challenges through data analysis and engaging with local partners and stakeholders.
As of the end of 2022, we’ve supported 38 water 
stewardship projects  in 26 watersheds (see Figure 20).  
In 2022 alone, we added 25 projects to our portfolio.
This marked a strong first year of implementation of our 
water replenishment strategy, and while we still have a long way to go to meet our 2030 target, we’re proud of the impactful partnerships that we’ve already engaged in around the world. We’re excited to continue working alongside our existing partners and to find new partners in water-stressed geographies where we’ll work over the next few years.TARGET

CALIFORNIA
We recently co-funded a pilot project to install water-saving 
technology  in three multi-family buildings in Los Angeles. The 
technology takes aim at behind-the-scenes leaks, like malfunctioning toilets, that are capable of leaking thousands of gallons of water in a single day. The pilot is on track to save a total of 6.4 million gallons of water a year in the L.A. watershed where we operate. We’re also funding work to bring this approach to parts of San Francisco and New York City.
ARIZONA
Surface water diversions from the Colorado River make up the primary source of irrigation water supply for the Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) reservation and CRIT farms. We’re working with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation to fund the CRIT to support irrigation infrastructure efficiency  by lining a leaky earthen irrigation canal—
reducing seepage loss and water diversion demands in the Colorado River watershed.
MEXICO
In Mexico City, Google partnered with Isla Urbana to provide households that don’t currently have reliable potable water connections to their homes with a source of easily accessible potable water via rainwater harvesting  and potabilization systems . We also partnered with 
Pronatura to support a comprehensive watershed study along with the implementation of multiple water management practices , 
including reforestation, the creation of a percolation pond to increase groundwater infiltration, and restoration activities to improve soil health.UNITED KINGDOM
We partnered with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation to fund Thames21 to support the creation of a system  of wetlands that will 
intercept and filter water at Chinbrook Meadows park before it enters the River Quaggy and the greater Thames River watershed, improving water quality with the added benefits of flood protection, climate adaptation, and recreation opportunities.
INDIA
We’re working with United Way of Hyderabad to restore the 
Mullakathuva Lake  in northwest Hyderabad, with CLEAN International 
to reopen 20 wells  across three cities, and with WaterAid to provide 
water, sanitation, and hygiene access to nearly 9,000 local residents 
in Hyderabad communities. These projects not only support our replenishment and water security goals, they also help strengthen  
public health in the communities that make up an important part of our global workforce.
CHILE
Google partnered with the Bonneville Environmental Foundation on two initiatives to improve watershed health in Chile’s Maipo Basin. We provided funding to our implementation partner, Kilimo, to scale up precision irrigation using AI  to support increased agricultural productivity, maintain 
or improve natural pest control, protect groundwater and surface water resources, and reduce water demand across 260 hectares of farmland. Google also supported The Nature Conservancy’s efforts to monitor, protect, and improve the management of the High Andean wetlands , 
which offer many climate and water resilience benefits, as well as advocate for its large-scale protection.

We work on getting environmental information on the world’s forests, fisheries, watersheds, and air into the hands of decision-makers, in support of our aims to both address a key need for informed decision-making, and to support efforts to scale models and solutions that make water resource information visible and actionable.
Google.org has also awarded millions of dollars in grants  
to promising water stewardship solutions, including:
 • BlueConduit , to develop publicly accessible tools 
to quantify and map hazardous lead service lines for vulnerable communities, a critical first step to replacing unsafe water infrastructure.
 • Global Water Watch , which aims to democratize 
information on water resources. This information will empower policymakers, conservation organizations, and communities to better manage water resources collectively.
 • American University of Beirut , to apply machine 
learning to weather and agricultural data to improve irrigation for resource-strapped farmers in Africa and the Middle East, providing farmers with near-real-time water use data predictions to conserve the region’s dwindling water resources.

The journey ahead
Our ambition
Humans are consuming natural resources 
and generating waste at alarming rates. We need 1.75 Earths to sustain our current rate of natural resource consumption, but we only have one planet.
 105 The circular 
economy aims to minimize waste and maximize reuse of existing materials. An important component of this is promoting safer materials for human and environmental health, to maximize their reuse potential. The circular economy offers a tremendous opportunity for new business and innovation, capable of generating an estimated $4.5 trillion in new economic output by 2030.
 106
The world can’t achieve net-zero carbon emissions 
without accelerating the circular economy. Roughly 45% of global GHGs come from embodied carbon emissions, generated from creating new goods and infrastructure.
 107 
We can reduce up to 10 GT of carbon by 2050 through circular strategies, such as using recycled materials and low-carbon building approaches.
 108
To support the transition to a circular economy, we aim to become a circular Google —maximizing the reuse of finite 
resources across our operations, products, and supply chains and enabling others to do the same.Our approach
Our impact on the circular economy cuts across all our core business operations. It includes the data centers we build and operate to power our products, the workplaces where Googlers come together to create the next breakthrough technology, and the consumer hardware products that people use every day. Our impact also spans the entire value chain, including data centers , 
workplaces and stores, products , and our suppliers , 
and we’ve set goals to measure our progress in each area.
Our circularity principles focus on designing out waste 
from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting healthy materials—for our data centers, workplaces, and products (see Figure 21).   56

Zero waste to landfill 
In 2016, we announced our aim to achieve Zero Waste 
to Landfill for our global data center operations. As of the end of 2022, 10 out of 26 (38%) Google-owned and -operated data centers have met this Zero Waste to Landfill target (see Figure 22). For example, our data center in Fredericia, Denmark, achieved Zero Waste to Landfill from day one. Our data center waste footprint increases as we increase the number of our data centers, so we continue working towards our target as we grow. In 2022, across our global fleet of Google-owned and -operated data center operations, we diverted 86% of operational waste away from landfills. 
Beyond these goals for landfill waste, our approach 
to circularity for data center equipment is to maintain servers for as long as possible, refurbish components for future reuse, reuse or resell components following a rigorous security process, and recycle any components that can’t be reused.
Since 2015, we’ve resold more than 37 million hardware 
components  from our data centers into the secondary 
market for reuse by other organizations, including nearly 5 million resold components in 2022 alone. As of the end of 2022, 21% of components used for server deployment, maintenance, and upgrades were refurbished inventory.
Looking forward, we continue to face challenges for waste 
diversion at a local level due to the lack of availability of recycling infrastructure in some of the rural communities where we operate and inconsistencies in what’s accepted for recycling.TARGET

2023 Environmental Report  Building circular workplaces and stores
Building design and construction is one of the largest 
sources of global waste—roughly 30% of all global annual waste comes from building construction and demolition.
 109 When we design and build Google 
workplaces and stores around the world, we strive to deliver on our commitment to accelerating the circular economy. 
When the right opportunity comes up, we pursue 
adaptive reuse projects, renovating existing buildings to serve a new purpose rather than demolishing them for new builds. These reuse projects tend to use fewer materials, produce less construction waste, and have lower embodied carbon. They also preserve community history, giving historic structures new life as Google workplaces and, in some cases, community spaces, too. 
Some examples include our Playa Vista , California , 
office—a repurposed 1943 airplane hangar, and our  
Pier 57 office in New York City—a historic cruise terminal 
and transit depot that sat vacant for 20 years before Google reimagined it into an office and community space. 
We also consider adaptive reuse for our data centers, 
such as for our data center in Hamina, Finland , which was 
formerly an abandoned paper mill.Circular design and 
construction
To make our workplaces more circular, we design 
adaptable spaces that can be adjusted over time using fewer renovation materials, we incorporate reuse and material salvage  practices, and we provide a rigorous 
model for healthy materials that can be adopted by others. For example, our Bay View and Charleston East  campuses both incorporate salvaged materials 
into the building design, and both aim to reduce future renovation waste through highly flexible and reconfigurable work areas.
For more than a decade, we’ve prioritized building 
materials that demonstrate safer chemistry to create healthy indoor environments and advance our circularity goals. One way we promote healthy materials is by leveraging third-party standards like the LBC, one of the most ambitious green building certifications in the world. Our focus on transparency aims to encourage stronger standards in the building industry at large, paving the way for others to purchase healthier materials. 
We recently opened or advanced several workplace 
and store projects that reflect these core principles of circular design and construction (see Figure 23). Our   
Bay View campus —opened in 2022—also incorporates 
our circularity principles of designing out waste from the start, keeping materials in use for as long as possible,  
and promoting healthy materials. Learn more in our  
Bay View spotlight .

Examples of circular design and construction at our workplaces and stores
237 Moffett Park Drive 
in Sunnyvale, California, U.S.A.
Our newest addition to Google’s Sunnyvale 
campus—237 Moffett Park Drive—is the world’s largest LBC Materials Petal Certified Renovation Typology project. The existing building was transformed into a workplace that embodies regenerative design and promotes well-being. Materials were given a second chance throughout the building—from still-functioning components of the original mechanical systems to roughly 300 interior doors made with veneer from oak trees salvaged from recent California wildfires. In total, nearly 3,400 tons of waste (or 91% of total waste generated) was diverted from landfill during its construction.
Charleston East
in Mountain View, California, U.S.A. 
In 2022, we advanced construction for our 
Charleston East campus, with the goal of expanding the boundaries of sustainable design, including around healthy and reclaimed materials. Charleston East is on track to achieve LEED-NC v4 Platinum certification and be one of the largest new construction projects ever to attain the LBC Materials Petal Certification, which helps ensure the health of the building occupants, the local community, and the broader supply chain. Using the LBC Red List as a framework, thousands of materials on the project went through a rigorous sourcing and review process. The design of Charleston East also incorporates salvaged materials and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified wood products.
Google store
in Chelsea, New York, U.S.A.
In 2021, we opened our first flagship retail store in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, which achieved LEED-ID+C Retail v4 Platinum status. Every element of the Google Store—the materials, building processes, mechanical systems and more—was painstakingly considered and selected. For example, the veneer on the walls is a soft gray, responsibly-sourced hickory, and our custom cork and wood furniture was created with a local craftsman from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. We even attached our carpeting (which was manufactured with recycled materials) in a sustainable way. In 2022, we opened our second retail location in Brooklyn, New York, which also earned a LEED-ID+C Retail v4 Platinum rating.
Bolands Mills  
in Dublin, Ireland
Our Bolands Mills office is the reincarnation of a 150-year-old flour mill, repurposed as a workspace for Googlers. There are plans for a public ground-floor food market that will reforge visitors’ connection to food. With Bolands Mills, we have the opportunity to preserve an iconic heritage site while creating a place that will support Google and the neighborhood for years to come.

2023 Environmental Report  Workplace Operations
We take a holistic approach to circularity in our offices, 
starting with designing buildings for zero-waste operations. Not only do we strive to divert solid waste from landfills and incinerators for office operations, but we also aim to minimize the amount of materials we use and maximize their lifespan within our ecosystem and the surrounding community. We have ambitious targets for food loss and waste , and we’re working to reduce single-
use plastics in our operations.
In 2022, the global landfill diversion rate for our offices 
was 75% . To ensure that what we keep out of landfills can 
actually be recovered, we prioritize diverting high-quality materials and only count non-contaminated recyclable material.

Food waste
Global searches for     “how to reduce food waste ”     
have more than doubled over the most recent five-year period compared to the previous five-year period,
 111 
reaching a 15-year high in 2022. 112 When food waste ends 
up rotting in landfills, it generates methane—a greenhouse gas that’s 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
 113 
 What’s more, when food goes to waste, so do all of the water, energy, and other resources that went into producing it.
To achieve a low-carbon circular economy, we need 
to collectively cut back on food waste. At Google, that means doubling down  on our efforts to reduce waste in 
our kitchens, cafes, and overall food operations.Our goal
In 2022, we announced our food waste goal: by 2025,  we aim to send zero food waste to the landfill. Towards this goal, we aim to cut food waste in half for each Googler, compared to a 2019 baseline.
We’re on track to cut food waste in half for each Googler 
and send zero food waste to the landfill by 2025. In 2022, we diverted 85% of food waste from landfill, and and we’ve reduced food waste per Googler by 18% since 2019.
 114 We’re seeing progress across all operations in 
all regions, across different types of cafes, and by using different intervention levers to spark necessary behavior and operational change. 
From 2014 through 2021, we prevented nearly 10 million 
pounds of food from entering landfills.
Our focus areas
To further reduce food waste, we’re strengthening our efforts in three key areas across our food program:
 • In our kitchen and cafe operations , we’re preventing 
waste from the moment we receive ingredients all the way through to serving a finished dish.
 • At the sourcing and procurement stage, we’re working with our suppliers, distributors, and vendors to prevent waste before it happens.
 • When there’s excess food —whether as prepared 
dishes or plate waste—we’re ensuring it’s donated or properly composted.TARGET

Scope: Annual food waste diverted from landfill in kitchens and cafes at Google’s offices globally. “Zero food waste to landfill” is defined as 99% diversion of food waste from landfill via composting, anaerobic digestion, or other on-site processing.
In our kitchen and cafe operations, we’re focused on ways to stop food waste before it starts.   61
2023 Environmental Report  Kitchen and cafe operations
We’re making measurable reductions across back-of-
house operations through improved culinary practices and demand planning to ensure our production levels are consistent with user dining patterns. 
For example, in the United States, we recorded a 22%–30% 
reduction in egg waste by cooking smaller batches, and in India we recorded a 50% reduction in per-plate waste following a multi-channel waste reduction campaign. 
Sourcing and procurement  
and excess food 
Additional progress will rely heavily on continued 
engagement of our vendor partner operations teams, further enabling Googlers to join in, and expanding partnerships with municipal and community organizations to accelerate the pace of food donations and develop compost infrastructure.
In 2022, to activate industry-wide change, Google 
provided $1 million in anchor funding to kickstart the ReFED Catalytic Grant Fund. The ReFED Catalytic Grant Fund provides nonprofit and for-profit organizations with recoverable and non-recoverable grants to de-risk and scale high-impact solutions to food waste.Single-use plastics
The world’s plastic pollution  problem is a large and 
complex challenge—more than 91% of plastic isn’t recycled, and the majority is left sitting in landfills or littering our oceans and communities.
 115 Reducing plastic 
waste requires entire industries to come together and take more meaningful action. At Google, that means rethinking our approach to the way we source products, serve food, and reduce our waste.
Improving our plastics footprint isn’t as simple as not 
buying single-use plastics. To reduce single-use plastics (upstream) and bridge the infrastructure gaps for recycling and composting (downstream), we need to activate the entire food ecosystem, from manufacturers to distributors to waste management companies. 
We do this by working with vendors and suppliers to 
avoid or phase out products with single-use plastics; rethinking how we handle, store, prepare, and serve  food and beverages; and using fully recoverable materials that are recyclable or compostable.
We’re piloting and scaling plastic-free processes  
and products in our kitchens, cafes, and overall food 
operations. For example, we’re installing beverage dispensers to replace single-use beverages. We’re redefining what we serve—and how we serve it—to eliminate single-use plastics and ensure durable, washable dishware and cutlery are easy to choose.
 Looking to the future, we’re also planning to create  
food spaces that design out waste from the start. 
 Designing  
more sustainable consumer hardware products
Our ambition  is to create consumer hardware products 
that leave people, the planet, and our communities better 
than we found them. Our consumer hardware products  
include Pixel, Nest, Chromecast, and Fitbit devices.
Since launching our first hardware products, we’ve 
integrated sustainability considerations into materials sourcing and science, engineering and supply chain operations, carbon emissions reductions, waste reduction, packaging products, and designing our  retail stores. 
We aim to increase the circularity of our hardware 
products and operations by decreasing our use of mined materials and signaling our demand for a more circular economy in our procurement of recycled materials. This is in addition to extending the life of our products through software updates and expanded repair options.
We support greener electronics standards and 
certifications, including UL 110, IEEE 1680.1, and the UL ECOLOGO Program.

 117   62
2023 Environmental Report  Recycled materials 
Reducing how much waste we generate as a company and 
minimizing the demand for new raw materials starts with how we source materials that go into our products.
In 2019, we announced our aim to include recycled 
materials in 100% of Google consumer hardware products launching in 2022 and every year after.
 118 We hit our goal 
early—in 2020—and have maintained it each year since for Nest, Pixel, and Chromecast devices.
 119 In 2020, we shared 
our next steps on this journey.
We committed to   use recycled or renewable material in at 
least 50% of plastic  used across our consumer hardware 
product portfolio by 2025, prioritizing recycled plastic everywhere we can. 41% of the plastic Google used in products manufactured in 2022 was recycled content.
 120
Approximately 30% of the material Google used in its new products  launched and manufactured in 2022 was 
recycled content.
 121 This includes recycled material used 
in our devices’ aluminum , stainless steel , rare-earth 
magnet , glass, and plastic  parts.

of Pixel 5, 6, 6 Pro, 7, and 7 Pro is made with 100% recycled content, reducing the carbon footprint of the aluminum portion of the enclosures by over 35% compared to 100% primary aluminum.
 122 Using recycled materials can also lower the carbon 
footprint of our product manufacturing. For example, the aluminum  in the phone enclosures of Pixel 5, 6, 6 Pro, 7, and 
7 Pro is made with 100% recycled content, reducing the carbon footprint of the aluminum portion of the enclosures by over 35% compared to 100% primary aluminum.
 123 For 
more information on recycled material content for each of our products, see our Product Environmental Reports .
While many waste materials can technically be recycled, whether or not they’re actually recycled depends on market demand. This is why we’ve strategically prioritized sourcing recycled materials for our products, in hopes that increased demand will help maximize the utility of materials we already use.TARGET

2023 Environmental Report  Sustainable packaging
Product packaging typically contains many materials—
like the plastic film materials you often see on electronic packages—which can be difficult to recycle. 
That’s why we’re committed to eliminating plastic from 
our hardware product packaging by 2025. By focusing on fiber-based materials , we’re enabling consumers to 
more easily recycle our packaging and ensure that the materials will be accepted in as many recycling systems  as possible.
We design Nest, Pixel, and Fitbit packaging to minimize 
the use of plastic. For new Google products launched and manufactured in 2022, our packaging was at least 96% plastic-free,
 126 and packaging for Pixel 7 and 7 Pro 
uses 99% plastic-free materials, 127 getting us closer to this goal. For more information on packaging for each of our products, see our Product Environmental Reports .

Product longevity
Creating truly sustainable electronics includes crafting experiences that guide consumers through the care, repair, reuse, and recycling of their products. While there’s much more work to do, we’ve taken some initial steps in understanding consumers’ and organizations’ needs and creating new services for them.
It all starts with making sure products last long to begin 
with. Enabling security updates and bug fixes helps promote product longevity. For Google Nest, we issue critical bug fixes and patches for at least five years after launch. Pixel 6 and later Pixel phones will get securityupdates for five years from when they first become available on the Google Store in the United States.
 130  
And new Chromebooks are built with sustainability in mind, with automatic updates for up to eight years that keep them running fast and secure.
Repairing electronics
Providing new ways to repair electronics is an important way to extend their lives. In 2022, we announced our partnership with iFixit  to provide genuine Pixel spare parts, 
tools, and documentation on models as far back as Pixel 2 for users who are skilled in repair and independent service providers. This partnership, alongside our other mail-in    64
2023 Environmental Report  and authorized service provider repair channels, lowers 
costs and expands the choices customers have in Pixel phone repair. In tandem with our trade-in program , this 
extends the usable life of Pixel phones.
In 2022, we announced ChromeOS Flex  and the 
Chromebook repair program , which aim to extend 
the useful life of laptops, PCs, and Chromebooks alike. 
ChromeOS Flex helps extend the life of aging Macs, PCs, and Linux devices by converting them to the ChromeOS ecosystem and reducing the amount of e-waste that’s generated. In addition to providing up to eight years of software updates for Chromebooks, schools can easily identify which Chromebooks have commonly repaired components—like the keyboard, display, and palmrest—through our new repair program site . This is just the first 
step, and we’re looking forward to hearing feedback to help grow and improve the program.
We partner with device manufacturers (OEMs) to help 
increase the number of new Chromebooks  that are made 
with recycled materials and are easy to customize, repair, and upgrade. For example, the new Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition, made of 50% post-consumer recycled aluminum, is the most customizable Chromebook yet. It’s durable, powerful, thin, light, and designed to last. Individuals can upgrade the laptop’s memory and storage; replace key parts like the screen, battery, and webcam; and swap out the bezel with different colors, all without needing to replace their entire laptop. E-waste recycling
Since all products will eventually become obsolete, availability of and participation in e-waste recycling programs is important to help keep electronics out of landfills and reuse the critical minerals within them. 
We’re focused on sourcing recycled and sustainable 
materials from our supply chain, and we recognize that the supply chain is only able to provide recycled materials when robust recycling collection, processing infrastructure, and technologies are available. For devices at the end of their service life, we offer free recycling in every country where we ship consumer hardware products.
 131
While e-waste recycling programs are generally available, they often have low consumer participation rates. That’s why, in 2022, we joined forces with industry peers and electronics recycling startup Retrievr on a new e-waste recycling pilot  designed to address the behavioral 
reasons that stop consumers from recycling. Unlike recycling household items like food packaging or shipping boxes, electronics have unique barriers  to overcome 
before consumers feel comfortable taking action. The goal of the pilot is to study how the industry can reduce barriers and increase participation in e-waste recycling.
The Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition is easy to upgrade and repair.   65
2023 Environmental Report  Working with suppliers
Manufacturing waste
Material that’s lost during the product manufacturing 
process (often called “yield losses”) generates waste in our supply chain, so it’s important to ensure that these waste streams are also captured and recycled. In 2020, we announced our target to achieve UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification at all final assembly manufacturing sites for our consumer hardware products by 2022.
In 2022, we certified 90% of our established consumer 
hardware final assembly sites to the UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill standard . These sites achieved at least Silver 
certification level (representing a minimum 90% landfill diversion), with half of our sites achieving Platinum level (representing 100% landfill diversion). We plan to certify the re m
aining sites in the future. We also aim to maintain 
certification for 100% of our final assembly sites, including new sites as they’re added.
We’ve completed a new waste-reduction pilot program 
focused on the packaging materials used to ship product parts from suppliers to final assembly sites. We worked with some suppliers to replace shipping materials with reusable and recyclable alternatives and to redesign packaging to use less material overall. For example, for Nest Wifi Pro, we partnered with multiple part suppliers in 2022 to replace an estimated 30 metric tons of plastic with corrugated cardboard, which is easier to recycle. Building on these early successes, we’re now engaging more suppliers and comprehensively reviewing packaging for many more parts across our portfolio, in hopes of identifying more opportunities to achieve even bigger waste reductions.

We’re protecting people and the planet through safer 
chemistry and responsible management across our hardware products. The chemical safety of materials plays a role in the impact they can have on natural ecosystems, supply chain workers, and users.
Through our Product Restricted Substances Specification  
and Manufacturer Restricted Substances List, we restrict 
many hazardous substances and ensure our suppliers have processes in place to detect and prevent them from entering the manufacturing process. We’ve laid  a solid foundation  as we pursue our next level goals in 
safer chemistry.
In 2022, we shared more details about our comprehensive 
Responsible Chemical Management program  that 
includes assessments, guidance, and training resources to help suppliers better mitigate occupational and environmental risks related to the chemicals they use. Recent initiatives have included in-depth assessment programs with greater levels of detail and transparency, extensive supplier training and guidance materials to more proactively manage risk, and new industry partnerships that al
low us to share best practices intended to  
advance the industry at large.
We continue to enroll suppliers into e-learning courses, 
which more than 250 manufacturing suppliers have completed as of the end of 2022—a number that continues growing as we extend trainings to more  supplier personnel.
We’re working to eliminate antimicrobials  and use 
safer flame retardants and solvents across our 
consumer electronics product portfolio. We’re also collaborating across the industry to find and promote the understanding of safer flame retardants available for the electronics sector. In 2022, we partnered with ChemFORWARD , a trusted nonprofit source for chemical 
hazard data and alternatives, on a proactive approach to assessing chemical safety beyond existing regulatory and industry norms. We’ve commissioned over 100 chemical hazard assessments and are working to make them available to others through the ChemFORWARD platform.

2023 Environmental Report  Enabling others
The circular economy requires everyone to participate 
to reach its fullest potential. That’s why we’re focused on sharing insights about our efforts so others can adopt them, and why we invest in creating technologies that enable everyone to have an impact.
For example, in 2022, we introduced product features 
that help people and businesses recycle clothing and other goods, and that help hardware customers keep their products in use longer. We’re also helping to improve recycling through accurate measurement and data-led insights using machine learning. In 2022, we shared details about CircularNet , a set of models that lowers barriers to using AI technology for waste identification. Our goal 
with CircularNet is to develop a robust and data-efficient model for waste/recyclables detection, which can support the way anyone in the waste management ecosystem can identify, sort, manage, and recycle materials.
We also support our partners to help discover, accelerate, 
and scale ecosystem solutions that can benefit everyone tackling waste and reuse challenges. In 2022 and early 2023, we worked to jumpstart partner innovation by launching multiple accelerators focused on circular economy solutions. Additional details can be found in the 
Working together  and Empowering individuals  sections.
A Googler swaps out a motherboard at our data center in The Dalles, Oregon. When server parts break,  we first try to repair them. If we can’t, we break them up into raw materials and recycle the components.The journey ahead
At Google, we believe that realizing a sustainable world means that we must accelerate the transition to a circular economy  where people, the planet, and businesses thrive. 
This is a large and complex global challenge, but we’ve 
always viewed a challenge as an opportunity to be helpful and make things better for everyone. 
While we’re excited about our journey to a circular 
economy, we recognize that we’ll face many challenges along the way. For example:
• Recovering and diverting resources from landfills requires robust collection and recycling infrastructure around the world, beyond what exists today.
• The lack of financially healthy end markets and local reuse infrastructure for salvaged resources often prevents or prohibits materials from making their way back into the economy.
• The circular economy requires better data to enable markets to identify, manage, and value available resources. More and higher-quality data is needed to inform capital investments, infrastructure priorities, business plans, policies, and other interventions.
• Accelerating the switch from using single-use plastics to more reusable solutions requires additional innovation with the potential to scale across large real estate portfolios.
• We’re exploring the connection between low-GHG construction materials and the circular economy, recognizing that recycled materials often have lower carbon footprints than virgin resources.
 133The challenge is large, but so is our ambition. We seek 
to enable others to embrace circularity, which is why we share knowledge and insight through research, product examples, and case studies with our partners, customers, and billions of users around the world. Examples include:
• Closing the plastics circularity gap
• Understanding barriers to electronics recycling
• Accelerating commercial deconstruction and reuse  
Our goal with this work is to accelerate progress towards a fully sustainable technology industry and real estate footprint operating on clean, efficiently used energy and made with safe and circular materials.

We strive to protect and enhance nature and biodiversity through our campuses and technology.
Google has offices in nearly 60 countries around the world 
(as of year-end 2022). In these locations, we aim to protect and enhance nature and biodiversity through a four-pillar approach that starts with building biodiversity at our own office and campus developments, as well as protecting nature and making it more accessible in the surrounding communities where we operate (see Figure 24). 
Our approach further focuses on sourcing responsibly 
across our supply chain. And our billions of users have the potential to have a positive impact on their environments if given the information and tools to do so, so we’re also developing technology to help increase nature’s resilience to climate change.

2023 Environmental Report  Building for biodiversity
Centuries of agricultural intensification and urbanization 
have transformed landscapes and native habitats around the world, including a loss of over 99% of native habitats in Silicon Valley.
 136 Google is working to bring nature back into 
the built environment—in part, by restoring critical habitats like oak woodlands  and willow groves across our Bay 
Area campuses. Our aim is to revive the area’s ecological heritage and bolster the human experience while creating thriving, functional landscapes for a biodiverse constellation of species. In the Bay Area and beyond, wherever possible, we strive to build biodiversity on-site at Google offices and campuses by designing for ecology and bringing nature back to cities.
Designing for ecology
We increase native, biodiverse habitats on our development sites through both large- and small-scale efforts that prioritize local species. For example, we contributed to the restoration of the Charleston Retention Basin  near our 
Bay Area campuses, including nearly 6 acres
 137 of new and 
enhanced freshwater marsh, native upland, and riparian communities, and we continue to protect a rookery  that’s 
regionally important for the local egret population. In 2022, we created nearly 5 acres of new habitat on our campuses for monarch butterflies and other pollinators.
As of the end of 2022, we’ve created and restored  more 
than 40 acres of habitat on Google’s campuses and 
the surrounding urban landscape, primarily in the Bay Area—including 17 acres at our Bay View campus. We’ve also planted roughly 4,000 native trees on our Bay Area campuses. In collaboration with local NGOs, ecology experts, and government agencies, this work spans from creating welcoming habitat patches for pollinators to partnering on larger projects like restoring the Charleston Retention Basin. Together, these efforts drive landscape-scale restoration of historical ecosystems like oak woodlands, willow groves, and creek and wetland habitats (see Figure 25).
FIGURE 25
How we’re restoring native habitats in Silicon ValleyWe’ve established  landscape design practices that ensure 
ecologically-designed landscapes thrive over the long term, primarily through our internal Habitat Design Guidelines. The guidelines help landscape designers leverage plant choices and layout to maximize wildlife habitat value. They include detailed guidelines on native plant palettes, planting structure and density, plant requirements, maintenance requirements, and bird-safe practices. To promote wider use and impact of these guidelines, we sponsored the publication of a public version  that’s freely available for 
landscape managers in public, private, and NGO settings. In addition, our ecology team also issues guidelines on native landscape maintenance, pollinator habitats, bird bath and nest design, plant pathogen prevention, and recycled water use for native plants. All Bay Area ground-up construction projects completed in 2022 incorporated bird-friendly design elements to reduce the risk of window collisions.
In 2022, we opened Bay View , the first major campus 
designed by Google, and the most comprehensive 
example yet of our approach to designing for ecology. Bay View features over 17 acres of high-value natural areas—including wet meadows, woodlands, and a marsh—designed to reestablish native landscapes and rehabilitate Bay Area wetlands . Learn more in our Bay View spotlight .2022 HIGHLIGHT

2023 Environmental Report  Restoring habitat for 
monarch butterflies
We’re taking steps to help address the threat facing 
California’s monarch butterflies—pollinators that are important to our ecosystem. In 2020, California only saw 2,000 monarch butterflies during the winter: a more than 90% decline from the millions of monarchs that visited the state in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
 138
Given our significant presence in California, in 2021,  
we announced  our aim to support the creation, 
restoration, and/or enhancement of 600 acres of habitat 
for monarchs  and other pollinators across California, 
including creating more habitat on our campuses. We’ve put $500,000 toward this effort on our campuses, and Google.org  granted another $500,000 to the Xerces 
Society and Peninsula Open Space Trust for habitat work across the state.
To date, this has helped to restore and enhance more 
than 500 acres of monarch and pollinator habitat across California, including creating nearly 5 acres of new habitat on our campuses in 2022.
2022 HIGHLIGHT
We’ve provided grants to help 
restore and enhance more than  500 acres of monarch and pollinator habitat across California.Bringing nature back to cities
We’re also bringing nature back to many cities where we 
operate. Global search interest in     “pollinators ”    and   
   “tree planting ”     reached all-time highs in 2022. 139 
In urban areas around the world, we’re designing nature into the built environment to improve urban biodiversity and connect people to nature. For example, our Platform G building in London’s King’s Cross neighborhood will include 
a biodiverse green roof and planting palette designed to support native birds, bats, bees, and insects, designed in collaboration with the London Wildlife Trust. A densely planted outdoor roof garden with a rainwater irrigation system will provide a habitat for protected species of bats and birds, as well as offering a quiet green space for breaks during the work day. We’re collaborating with the London Wildlife Trust as part of a wider initiative to protect our native species and improve local biodiversity.
In city centers lacking greenspace, the urban heat island 
effect produces higher temperatures, leading to increased energy needs, air pollution, and heat-related illness.
 140 
Google is helping to abate the urban heat island effect by prioritizing plantings, green open spaces, and tree canopy cover on our campuses, as well as reducing impermeable surfaces like concrete. 
We published insights from some of this work in an 
academic paper , aiming to inspire others and provide them 
with tools and techniques for integrating nature into dense urban areas.

2023 Environmental Report  Protecting nature and making it 
more accessible
We recognize that our campus landscapes exist as part 
of greater natural ecosystems, so it’s important that we work to protect and support nature—and make it more accessible to people—both on our campuses and across the broader communities where we operate. In the Bay Area and elsewhere across our portfolio where appropriate, we nurture nature by supporting restoration efforts beyond our campuses and by planning for resilience. We also connect people and nature by providing community access to nature and improving worker health through biophilic design.
Nurturing nature across 
ecosystems
We invest in restoration projects outside of Google’s 
campuses to build health across the wider ecosystem and accelerate our water stewardship goals. In addition to grants mentioned above to create and maintain pollinator habitat, we also support efforts to strengthen the ecological resilience of critical natural systems like the San Francisco Bay . In 2022, we partnered with the 
San Francisco Estuary Institute to create the Shoreline Resilience Framework for Wildlife Support , which is being 
used by regional agencies to identify, map, and enhance functions that contribute to shoreline resilience. These functions may include protecting the shoreline from erosion, supporting threatened and endangered species, and maintaining critical landscape processes like marsh migration with sea-level rise.Connecting communities 
and nature
We invest for the long term, so we want to care for the 
environments and communities where we operate. We engage with local communities and leading programming that extends the benefits of nature to all. For example, in partnership with the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, the City of Mountain View, and other organizations, Google hosts “Egret Office Hours” at the Shorebird Way rookery  so the public can safely see 
moments throughout the egret breeding cycle. 
As another example, we created the Green Loop, a 
publicly accessible pedestrian and cycling trail connecting some of our buildings in Mountain View . The Green Loop 
was designed with native vegetation to enhance habitats for pollinators and other wildlife (including nearly 100 native trees), as well as to help manage stormwater.
We ensure that Googlers  have access to the benefits 
of high-quality biodiverse nature through incorporating 
exterior landscapes and access to nature on our campuses, as described above. We also focus on bringing attributes of natural environments into our interior spaces by applying biophilic design practices, such as nature-inspired architecture, interior, and landscape design. To further this, we collaborated on an initiative with the ILFI to make a Biophilic Design Toolkit that was launched in 2022 and is freely available for anyone to use. Some recent buildings that reflect this approach to biophilic design include:
 • Bay View (Mountain View, CA):  With an abundance of biophilic design elements from natural light to accessible trails, our Bay View campus was a finalist for the 2023 Stephen R. Kellert Biophilic Design Award , presented by ILFI to recognize leading 
examples of biophilic design in the built environment. Learn more in our Bay View spotlight . • Pier 57 (New York, NY):  In 2022, we opened Pier 57 in New York City, which incorporates water views and plantings throughout the building to support biophilic design.
 • Moffett Park (Sunnyvale, CA): In Sunnyvale, we’re building our first ground-up mass timber building , which will incorporate biophilic design 
principles by exposing the natural timber structure to building occupants, and by providing abundant views and daylight throughout the interior.
The Shorebird Way rookery on our Mountain View, California campus reflects a broader effort to design  
and build our offices with local environments, ecology, and animal habitats in mind.    71
2023 Environmental Report  Sourcing 
responsibly
We’re focused on sourcing responsibly across our supply 
chain by procuring sustainable building and hardware materials and supporting biodiverse food systems.
We procure building materials for development projects 
and hardware materials for products aiming to minimize negative impacts on global biodiversity. For example, for new campus developments, we’ve incorporated timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC)—the 
world’s leading forest certification system for sustainable wood building materials. The first time Google led the concept and construction of our own major campuses, Google and our development partners prioritized FSC certification of all new wood purchased and installed, achieving over 96% FSC-certified wood at Bay View.
 141 
Our efforts earned us a 2021 FSC Leadership Award, which recognizes excellence in responsible forest management and conservation.
We work to ensure our food operations contribute 
positively to global biodiversity. Across our cafes, our Food team is focused on increasing the proportion of agrobiodiverse crops  featured on our menus. We 
leverage procurement practices and menu design to replace monocrop commodities with climate-resilient crops, and jump-start local markets to support agrobiodiversity. In addition to agrobiodiversity, we also support regenerative agriculture practices . This work 
builds on the Food team’s vision of helping to feed the world responsibly and sustainably.Developing technology to address 
biodiversity loss
We build tools and technology that enable partners, 
NGOs, governments, and academics around the world to help address nature and biodiversity loss. Our most impactful technology in this area is Google Earth Engine , 
a leading technology platform for planetary-scale environmental monitoring such as land use change, the most significant driver of biodiversity loss. Additionally, we’ve helped launch other platforms that help protect nature, such as TraceMark , a sustainable sourcing solution that improves supply chain transparency. We also use AI to help partners unlock new advances, such as our machine learning model that helps the scientific community in detecting humpback whale sounds, or in finding hopeful signs of wildlife recovery  after wildfires.
While supporting expert partners is important, we also believe technology should help everyone do their part for nature and biodiversity. That’s why many of our products aim to engage our users in nature-related tools, product features, and information. For example, Google Shopping restricts the sale and trade of endangered species via content moderation policies. Additionally, we provide free API access to our Maps and Places products for some nature-related uses, such as the iNaturalist app , which 
helps people learn more about their local environment.
Additional details on how we’re developing breakthrough 
technologies to address nature and biodiversity loss can be found in the Working together  and Empowering 
individuals  sections.
We’ve incorporated timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in our new campuses developments.   72
2023 Environmental Report  The journey ahead
Our approach to protecting nature has important co-
benefits. Protecting nature helps sequester carbon, and sequestering carbon helps preserve nature. Water stewardship helps nature thrive, and thriving ecosystems support water stewardship. By promoting circularity, we’re reducing the extraction of natural resources, which in turn protects against environmental degradation—a direct driver of biodiversity loss. For that reason, we’ll seek to evaluate these efforts with a more holistic view.
While we’re excited about our work to protect and 
enhance nature and biodiversity through our campuses and technology, we recognize that we face some challenges, including:
 • Navigating the local complexities of biodiversity and ecosystem health, as well as forging a broad set of partners to ensure collective action.
 • Feeding a global workforce responsibly and sustainably while supporting agrobiodiversity and regenerative agriculture practices.
 • Procuring healthy materials for our campuses and products while encouraging manufacturing partners to embrace responsible material sourcing practices.
 • Expanding the nature and biodiversity practices that work in one region to more of the areas where we operate around the world.
 • Effectively measuring nature and biodiversity.Our research papers, articles, and toolkits are intended to help others adopt some of the approaches that have worked for us, from restoring native habitats to integrating nature into cities.
 • Habitat design guidelines
 • Biophilic Design Toolkit
 • Toolkit for supporting nature in cities
 • Integrating nature into urban areas
Moving ahead, we’ll continue to build partnerships with others, using lessons from our own efforts alongside new tools and technology to help everyone take action.

2023 Environmental Report  SPOTLIGHT
Building a more sustainable 
campus in Mountain View
An interior photo of the canopy ceiling at our Bay View campus. (Photo: Iwan Baan)In 2022, we opened Bay View  in Mountain 
View, California, the first major campus 
developed by Google. From the start,  we had big ambitions  for this project:  
re-envisioning the workplace with a focus on prioritizing the human experience  and 
community-centered development .
Bay View has now achieved LEED Platinum certification 
and is on track to be the largest project to attain LBC Water Petal Certification, two of the world’s most ambitious building standards. These achievements reflect our goal of building sustainability into everything at Bay View: it integrates low-carbon design, helps regenerate local ecosystems, incorporates circularity principles, and is on track to achieve net water-positive  status.
Net-zero carbonBay View is a fully electric campus with on-site solar energy and nearby wind farms that are expected to help it operate on 90% clean energy. It features a first-of-its-kind dragonscale solar roof  across all three buildings, 
which use the latest building-integrated photovoltaic technology . Unlike a flat roof, where each panel 
generates peak power at the same time of the day, the roof’s unique shape enables it to generate power during an extended number of daylight hours.
To heat and cool the buildings, Bay View houses an 
innovative geothermal energy system , which is expected 
to help reduce the building’s carbon emissions compared with a conventional, code-compliant baseline, per our predictive models. This integrated geothermal pile system also enabled us to electrify the building’s overall systems more effectively, because recycling ground heat requires less energy than creating new heat. Bay View also features our largest electric kitchen, through which we’re learning lessons that will inform the transition of all our kitchens to electric cooking.
Water stewardship
To help address local water scarcity, Bay View is on track to meet the LBC’s definition of “ net water positive ,” 
meaning it’s designed to produce more recycled water than the site requires. Predictive models estimate that the on-site geothermal energy system is expected to help reduce about 90% of the water needed for cooling, compared with a traditional cooling tower system. To further reduce water use, we designed the campus landscapes with native plants and drought-tolerant species that don’t require as much watering.
We’re also capturing and reusing water on-site when 
possible. Stormwater retention ponds and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment were integrated into the site landscape. A central plant treats stormwater gathered from retention ponds and wastewater collected from buildings, producing recycled water that can be used for cooling towers, flushing toilets, and irrigation.
Circular economy
Bay View incorporates our circularity principles  of 
minimizing waste, keeping materials in use for as long as possible, and promoting healthy materials  that are safe 
for people and the environment. We’ve diverted 76%    74
2023 Environmental Report  of construction waste from landfill, and over 96% of all 
new timber used in the campus is certified by the FSC, 142 
earning us a 2021 FSC Leadership Award . We designed 
flexible workspaces, including easily adjustable partition walls, reducing the need for new materials as our needs evolve. And we vetted thousands of materials against the LBC’s “Red List” to avoid toxins and create the healthiest environment possible, from the carpet tiles and paints to the plywood and furniture.
Nature and biodiversity
Bay View is the most comprehensive example yet of our approach to designing for ecology. The site was designed to integrate with the native landscape and regenerate 
local ecosystems  such as wetlands. It features over 
17 acres of high-value natural areas—including wet meadows, woodlands, and a marsh.
The significant amount of open space was thoughtfully 
designed to echo pre-development water flows through stormwater treatment areas, which include open-water ponds that provide a habitat for aquatic wildlife. New willow groves provide a critical habitat for local wildlife and migrating songbirds, which have almost entirely disappeared from the South Bay. Additionally, pollinator gardens help the campus meet the LBC’s urban agriculture criteria, recognizing the key role of native pollinators—such as bees—in local food production and ecosystem health.
Bay View provides Googlers and community members 
with access to nature through landscape restoration and accessible trail networks. We also applied biophilic design  principles to the interior spaces, aiming to capture 
proven health benefits for workers through approaches such as clerestory windows, which provide access to natural light from every work area. Due to these efforts, Bay View was a finalist for the 2023 Stephen R. Kellert Biophilic Design Award .
Replicable solutionsFrom the start of this project, we aimed to create shared value  through replicable solutions  and innovations  that 
could benefit others and drive innovation forward. The dragonscale roof taught us how to integrate solar panels into a building skin in ways that we believe can help standardize this practice. The on-site wastewater treatment system can hopefully make it easier for others in the area to design similar systems by paving the way for local codes to evolve. And our strategies to minimize construction waste involved working closely with manufacturers to reduce packaging, an effort we believe could help others with similar goals. To share our learnings and help raise awareness across the development industry, we released a book  outlining all 
these innovations, in the hopes of ultimately expanding the impact of this project around the world.

2023 Environmental Report  About Google
As our founders explained in their first 
letter to shareholders , Google’s goal is to 
“develop services that significantly improve 
the lives of as many people as possible.” 
We believe in technology’s potential to have a positive 
impact on the world. That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to tackle big problems and invest in moonshots, such as our long-term opportunities in AI. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.
Alphabet is a collection of businesses—the largest of 
which is Google. Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud. Google Services’ core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Our consumer hardware includes Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel devices. Our Google Cloud offerings include Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace.
Our headquarters are located in Mountain View, 
California. We own and lease office facilities and data centers around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. To learn more, see our data center locations  and our office locations .

Sustainability governance
Alphabet’s Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit and Compliance Committee the primary responsibility for the oversight of many of the risks facing our businesses. The Audit and Compliance Committee reviews and discusses with management any major risk exposures, including sustainability risks, and the steps that Alphabet takes to detect, monitor, and actively manage such exposures.In 2022, Google evolved its approach to sustainability governance by creating a Sustainability Focus Area, an internal team led by our SVP of Learning and Sustainability that provides centralized management oversight of sustainability and climate-related issues.The Sustainability Focus Area includes the Chief Sustainability Officer and executives from across the company with diverse skills, from teams such as operations, products, finance, marketing, legal, communications, and policy, among others. Through the Sustainability Focus Area, sustainability and climate ambitions are built into our company-wide goals, plans of action, management policies, performance objectives, and how we monitor progress.    77
2023 Environmental Report  Risk management
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team is responsible 
for identifying, assessing, and reporting risks related to the company’s operations, financial performance, and reputation. As with financial, operational, and strategic risks, the team assesses environmental risks as part of the company’s overall risk management framework. The risks and opportunities identified through this process support public disclosures and inform Google’s environmental sustainability strategy. Our Chief Sustainability Officer and sustainability teams work to address risks by identifying opportunities to reduce the company’s environmental impacts from its operations and value chain, and through improving climate resilience. 
Climate-related 
risks
Climate-related risks and opportunities have long time 
horizons with high uncertainty regarding how climate trends, policy, and socio-economic factors might evolve in the future. Google continues to build on qualitative and quantitative risk assessments to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, and to understand their associated impact.
In 2015, Google developed a set of Principles of Climate 
Resilience , which support our definition of climate risk 
and resilience. From there, we created a framework that prioritizes the impact on people (including communities, users, and Googlers), so that it represents the different aspects of climate resilience within Google, as well as the internal and external actors who either influence or are influenced by Google’s climate resilience decisions. These ideas continue to inform how we think about addressing long-term climate risk.
In 2020, Google conducted a climate risk assessment, 
which included a low and high emissions climate scenario analysis. This assessment modeled the impact of flooding, water stress, extreme heat, and wildfires on 26 priority office sites and 23 data center locations. The key result of this scenario analysis was that increased exposure to extreme heat and flooding is likely to impact many of our global offices and data centers as early as 2030, if not sooner. We consider these results when planning Google’s overall development strategy.
In 2022, Google increased its efforts to align our 
climate risk assessment process more closely with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD), leveraging 
the TCFD categories of risks and opportunities and conducting climate scenario analyses. In an effort to drive completeness and consistency when reviewing these categories, we adopted our ERM rating scales (i.e., impact, frequency, likelihood, control effectiveness) to identify and prioritize areas of focus.
In 2022, climate-related risks and opportunities were 
analyzed in three time horizons—short term (through 2030), medium term (through 2040), and long term (through 2050)—for financial, operational, legal, and strategic risks. We considered acute and chronic physical risk perils such as heat stress, water stress, hail, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, droughts, wildfires, and wind gusts. We also considered risks associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy (e.g., energy costs, future regulations, technology, market, and reputational risks, among a few). We also assessed numerous climate-related opportunities such as building and expanding climate solutions to support users’ journeys to a low-carbon world, improving office and data center efficiency, and advancing new energy efficient technologies.
 
Water-related 
risks
To identify and assess water-related risks in our direct 
operations, Google annually undertakes a water risk assessment to identify priority locations with potential water-related risks that may present opportunities for water stewardship action. Indicators from available risk assessment tools, including WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 3.0 and WWF Water Risk Filter 6.0, are blended with other metrics to evaluate risks related to scarcity, flooding, water quality, sanitation and hygiene, reputation, and regulatory stressors. 
For our data center operations specifically, in 2022  
Google finalized the development and application of a context-based water risk and impact methodology to generate more granular insights than can be provided by water risk screening tools. It provides a framework to measure and evaluate site-level water risks, and the potential watershed impact, to inform our decision-making process for new site selection, water cooling design, and ongoing operations.To identify and assess water-related risks in our supply chain, we’ve conducted a supply chain water use analysis and a supplier risk assessment using WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, WWF’s Water Risk Filter, and WULCA AWARE . The key risks identified included baseline water 
stress, flood risk, access to safe drinking water, and the level of sanitation and hygiene services. This assessment enabled us to identify priority locations for supplier engagement in Central America, Asia, and the United States.
To safeguard the health of local waterways, we stipulate 
that suppliers “[treat water] as required prior to discharge or disposal of all wastewater.” To support the health and wellbeing of those in the communities we operate in, suppliers must “provide workers with ready access to clean toilet facilities [and] potable water.” We conduct regular supplier audits to monitor adherence to our code of conduct. Additionally, we’ve engaged our suppliers through the CDP Supply Chain Water Security questionnaire, inviting them to disclose their water management efforts.

center help keep our servers running efficiently.   78
2023 Environmental Report  Stakeholder engagement
We believe in the importance of outside perspectives 
to help inform our business decisions. We actively engage with our stakeholders (e.g., employees, NGOs, policymakers, customers, researchers, academics, and investors) throughout the year on a broad range of environmental topics. 
Our engagement enables us to better understand our stakeholders’ perspectives, elaborate on our environmental strategy, and progress against key targets, and it creates a vital two-way dialogue that informs our approach to the work.
See below for more information on how we engage 
with employees, suppliers, policymakers, and partners. For additional information on how we collaborate with customers, researchers, academics, and NGOs, see the Working together  section.
Employee 
engagement
Sustainability is part of our culture, and we give our 
employees opportunities to engage on environmental issues and put their passions into practice.
To celebrate Earth Day, we host an annual virtual event 
for employees to learn more about what Google is doing to empower people to make more sustainable choices, support our partners and customers, and operate our business more sustainably. Throughout the year, we invite thought leaders and experts to speak about the latest sustainability trends, and we post some of these talks publicly on our Talks at Google YouTube channel. Employees can also access online sustainability courses and can join global and local internal community groups focused on sustainability topics. Some employees also take on a 20% project —an opportunity to work 
on something outside of their primary role—related to sustainability. One great example of this is Project Sunroof, which began as a 20% project back in 2015. Lastly, employees have the opportunity to learn about sustainability through internal newsletters and education campaigns.
Supplier 
engagement
Through our supplier responsibility  program , we’re 
working to build an energy-efficient, low-carbon, 
circular supply chain that makes smart use of the Earth’s resources, protects ecosystems, and helps to combat climate change. We focus on the areas where we can make an immediate and lasting impact, such as helping our suppliers improve their environmental performance and integrate inclusivity, climate resilience, water stewardship, and circular design into our supply chain. We believe these principles can play a key role in reducing environmental impact and protecting human rights and community health.Google’s Supplier Code of Conduct includes requirements 
that enable us to ensure that those we partner with are responsible environmental stewards. Along with having suppliers evaluate their operations, we perform our own ongoing due diligence and audits to verify compliance and to understand our supply chain’s current and potential risks.
When we find that a supplier isn’t complying, we expect 
that supplier to provide a corrective action plan (CAP) that outlines the root cause of the finding, how and when that company will resolve the issue, and what steps it will take to prevent recurrence. We determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the severity of the noncompliance and the effort and time required to resolve the issue. We expect suppliers to demonstrate improvements to continue working with us. Our goal is to resolve the most severe issues immediately. We expect all other findings to be resolved in accordance with our guidelines as quickly as is practical. While we work with our suppliers to help them address our findings, in some instances, we may decide to no longer pursue a relationship or to terminate our current relationship.
In 2022, we audited a subset of our suppliers to verify 
compliance for the following environmental criteria: implementation of environmental management systems, environmental permits and reporting, product content restrictions, and resource efficiency, as well as management of hazardous substances, wastewater,  solid waste, and air emissions.

2023 Environmental Report  Public policy and advocacy
We know that strong public policy action is critical to 
creating prosperous, equitable, and resilient low-carbon economies around the world. 
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC)’s 2015 Paris Agreement states that humanity must “keep global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”
 143 Google 
remains unwavering in our commitment to the Paris Agreement, because climate scientists are clear: we have until 2030 to chart a sustainable course for our planet, or we’ll face the worst consequences of climate change.
 144 
In 2022, we saw major steps forward on climate policy in the United States, Europe, and other regions. New policy measures and corporate commitments will continue to play an important role in driving emissions reductions in the next decade. See Figure 26 for our position on climate policy. 
FIGURE 26
Our position on climate policy
At Google, we support public policies that:
• Strengthen global climate action efforts through the Paris Agreement, G20, and other multilateralforums to enhance international cooperation on climate.
• Establish emissions reduction targets and technology-neutral pathways  to achieve a low-carbon
economy in line with the IPCC’s guidance and scientific consensus. 145
• Use competitive, interconnected energy markets to empower consumers  and speed up the transition
to a clean economy.
• Accelerate the development and deployment of next generation low-carbon technology , including
harnessing digital technologies like AI and machine learning to support climate action across businesses,cities, governments, and civil society.
• Foster partnerships and deepen collaboration  across public and private actors to enable progress on
climate mitigation and adaptation by harnessing the full potential of climate solutions.
• Empower everyone to participate in the transition to a sustainable economy and ensure that the cleanenergy economy provides economic growth for all —spurring a new generation of green jobs, benefiting
the communities most impacted by a changing climate, and leaving no one behind in the transition.Policy 
engagement
Engagement on sustainability policy has been a top 
priority at Google for many years. Most recently, we were an official partner at COP-27  in 2022, where we 
participated in over 50 events and moments throughout the conference with public sector leaders from the United States, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia to call for amplified ambition on climate and to showcase the role that the technology sector can play in enabling climate mitigation and adaptation.
We’ve consistently supported strong climate policies 
around the world in our public policy engagement and advocacy. In 2020, we published a climate change public policy position statement, Realizing a carbon-free future: Google’s Third Decade of Climate Action , expressing 
our support for public policies that strengthen global climate action efforts through the Paris Agreement, establish emissions reduction targets and technology-neutral pathways to achieve a carbon-free economy, and accelerate the development and deployment of next generation low-carbon technology, among other provisions. In the United States, our federal lobbying report covering Q4 2022 includes our lobbying efforts with regard to U.S. federal climate and energy policy, including the Clean Energy for America Act, the CLEAN Future Act, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, all of which align with our advocacy for ambitious federal climate and clean energy policies.  
In Europe, our CEO Sundar Pichai shared virtual remarks at 
our inaugural Google European Sustainability Summit  in Brussels, which brought together policymakers, industry, and civil society to discuss how to accelerate climate action. He said, “At Google, we share the EU’s commitment to action, and want to be a helpful partner in that progress.” In the Asia-Pacific region, we provided a public submission and statement of support for Australia’s Climate Change Bill 2022 to enable the country to meet its Paris Agreement goals and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
We’ve led significant public policy engagement to support 
strong sustainability outcomes. For instance, in the United States last year, we provided comments  to the SEC’s 
proposed rule  on enhanced climate-related disclosures. 
In Europe, we shared input with the European Commission to support policy measures to make smartphones and tablets, along with other devices, more repairable and sustainable. We also advocated for measures in the EU Renewable Energy Directive to support 24/7 carbon-free energy supply models that enable companies to source clean energy for their operations.

2023 Environmental Report  Reporting approach and 
methodology
Report scope
This report includes data covering our fiscal year 
January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. Most of our environmental data covers Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiaries, the largest of which is Google. All reported data is global and annual unless otherwise specified. 
Data 
measurement and uncertainty
All reported values represent the best data available at time 
of publication. Where actual data isn’t available, we may use estimates. We base our estimates and methodologies on historical experience, available information, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. 
All environmental data found in this report is subject to 
measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. As we improve our methodologies and as new information becomes available, we may continue to revise our estimates and assumptions. Methodology changes may include changes in a calculation, improvements in the quality of data, new activity types for greater data granularity, and updates to available supplier-reported data. Such updates may result in material changes to our calculations and may also result in adjustments made to the current and previous periods, including our base year. Where material, we’ve disclosed these changes and whether previous periods have been adjusted to reflect these updates.
Assurance
We obtain limited third-party assurance from an independent auditor for certain environmental data, including select GHG emissions, energy, and water metrics as indicated in our E nvironmental data tables  
below. Ernst &amp; Young LLP reviewed these metrics for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For more details, see our 2022 Independent Accountants’ Review Report .
Prior to fiscal year 2019, another third party verified the following emissions: Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 2 (location-based), Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting), and biogenic. For more information, see our prior annual Environmental Reports.Methodology
The below methodologies apply to our GHG emissions, as well as certain other carbon, energy, and water metrics as presented in our Environmental data tables , focused 
primarily on those where we have obtained third-party limited assurance. These metrics have been rounded as described below. Due to rounding applied to all reported years of data in our 2023 Environmental Report, some of our reported values for prior years don’t directly match the related Independent Accountants’ Review Reports from those years.
Greenhouse gas 
emissions
GHG emissions reporting standards
GHG emissions are calculated according to the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol standards and guidance developed by the WRI and the WBCSD, including A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), Scope 2 Guidance, and Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (collectively, “the Greenhouse Gas Protocol”). 
Our inventory
We use the operational control approach to define our organizational boundary, which means that we account for all emissions from operations over which we have control. We define operational control as having the authority to introduce and implement operational policies over an asset, and we report all energy and emissions for Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiaries’ data centers, offices, and other assets under our operational control (“Global Facilities”). In September 2022, Google acquired Mandiant, and Mandiant’s emissions are included in our organizational boundary for fiscal year 2022.
Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions include four of the 
seven GHGs addressed by the Kyoto Protocol—carbon dioxide (CO
2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Other GHGs, including perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF
6), and 
nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), aren’t included in our inventory, 
as they’re not emitted as a result of our operations. Further, in 2022, CO
2 alone represented over 98% of our 
total Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions. We convert all emissions to metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO
2e) for reporting. All reported values are 
rounded to the nearest hundred, unless otherwise noted.
We source the global warming potentials (GWP) for each 
GHG from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Appendix A: Global Warming Potentials.
Scope 1 GHG emissions
Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct emissions from sources such as company vehicles or generators at our offices and data centers. They represent direct emissions from owned Global Facilities, including fuel use from back-up generators, fuel consumption from our operated vehicles and aircraft, methane and nitrous oxide from biogenic fuel sources, natural gas usage, and refrigerant leakage. Where actual data isn’t available, estimated natural gas consumption is calculated using square footage of Global Facilities and internally-developed natural gas intensity    87
2023 Environmental Report  factors by office type, based on data from the current 
fiscal year. 
Beginning in 2022, in an effort to continuously implement 
best practice methodologies, we included fugitive 
emissions from refrigerant leakage in our operational 
boundary. These emissions represented approximately 
17% of our 2022 Scope 1 GHG emissions. Where actual 
refrigerant leakage data isn’t available, we estimate 
refrigerant leakage using an internally-developed 
global warming potential and a leakage rate. We didn’t 
recalculate our Scope 1 GHG emissions for prior years to 
include refrigerant leakage.
The emission factors used to calculate Scope 1 emissions 
include the 2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Emission 
Factors from Cross Sector Tools, the 2023 EPA Center 
for Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission 
Factors Hub, and the 2022 Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) U.K. Government GHG 
Conversion Factors.
Scope 2 GHG emissions
Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from 
purchased electricity, the production of space heating for 
our leased offices, and refrigerant leakage at our leased 
offices. The location-based method reflects the average 
carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations 
are located and thus where our electricity consumption 
occurs. The market-based method incorporates our 
procurement choices, namely our renewable energy 
purchases via contractual mechanisms like power 
purchase agreements (PPAs). 
Actual data, such as third-party invoices, is used 
to calculate Scope 2 emissions. Where actual data isn’t available, estimated electricity and natural gas 
consumption is calculated using square footage of Global 
Facilities and internally developed electricity and natural 
gas intensity factors by office type, based on data from 
the current fiscal year. 
Beginning in 2022, emissions from estimated refrigerant 
leakage were calculated using an internally-developed 
global warming potential and leakage rate. Refrigerant 
leakage included in Scope 2 GHG emissions is immaterial. 
We didn’t recalculate prior year Scope 2 GHG emissions to 
include refrigerant leakage.
The emission factors used to calculate Scope 2 (location-
based) emissions include the 2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG 
Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, 
the 2022 IEA Emission Factors, the 2023 EPA eGRID 
Emission Factors, and the 2022 Climate Registry Default 
Emission Factors.
The emission factors used to calculate Scope 2 (market-
based) emissions include the 2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG 
Protocol Emission Factors from Cross Sector Tools, the 
2022 IEA Emission Factors, the 2022 Association for 
Issuing Bodies European Residual Mixes, the 2023 EPA 
eGRID Emission Factors, the 2022 Climate Registry Default 
Emission Factors, and emission factors specific to energy 
attribute certificates. The adjusted emission factors from 
the Association for Issuing Bodies European Residual 
Mixes are used for European facilities. Outside of Europe, 
adjusted emission factors aren’t available to account for 
voluntary purchases.Scope 3 GHG emissions
Scope 3 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from 
other sources in our value chain, such as our suppliers, 
use of our consumer hardware products, and business 
travel. We estimate our Scope 3 GHG emissions using 
the the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Technical Guidance 
for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0), in the 
following categories identified as relevant: 
• Category 1: Purchased goods and services
• Category 2: Capital goods
• Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution
• Category 6: Business travel
• Category 7: Employee commuting, including 
teleworking
• Category 11: Use of sold products
• Category 12: End-of-life treatment of sold products
In our Environmental data tables , we present certain 
emissions from Category 1, Category 2, Category 11, 
nd Category 12 as an aggregated subtotal—“Other 
categories”—for business reasons, as described further 
below.
Our Operational Scope 3 emissions are made up of 
Category 6 and Category 7, and are third-party assured. 
All reported Scope 3 emissions values are rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
Category 1: “Purchased goods and services” includes 
emissions generated from manufacturing consumer 
hardware and our food program. To estimate full supply 
chain emissions generated from manufacturing consumer 
hardware, we perform third-party-verified Life Cycle 
Assessments (LCAs) in accordance with ISO 14040 and 
14044. For our food program, we use LCA emission factors from WRI and annual Bay Area procurement 
volumes to estimate emissions, which we extrapolate to 
our global operations using building admittances.
In our Environmental data tables , emissions from 
manufacturing consumer hardware products are 
presented in Category 2: “Capital goods.” Emissions from 
our food program are presented in “Other categories.”
Category 2: “Capital goods”  includes upstream 
emissions from the production of capital goods 
we’ve purchased, including computing and storage 
hardware used in our data centers. This category also 
includes emissions from data center construction. For 
manufacturing of capital goods, we collect supplier 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions data directly from our 
hardware contract manufacturers, component suppliers, 
and fabless suppliers through the CDP Supply Chain 
Program; these suppliers represent our key “Tier 1” 
hardware manufacturing suppliers with whom we have 
a direct relationship. Where supplier emissions data 
isn’t available, we estimate with industry-average GHG 
intensities by commodity type and spend data. Data 
center construction emissions are estimated by using an 
LCA analysis to derive construction emissions data and 
then applying this to our construction activity. 
In our Environmental data tables , emissions from our 
Tier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in 
Category 2: “Capital goods,” and emissions beyond our 
Tier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in 
“Other categories.” Data center construction emissions 
are presented in “Other categories.”
Category 4: “Upstream transportation and 
distribution” includes emissions generated primarily 
from transportation and warehousing of our consumer    88
2023 Environmental Report  products and data center equipment. We collect 
consumer products and data center equipment 
transportation emissions from our logistics providers. 
These well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG emissions are 
calculated based on fuel use or weight-distance data 
and routing associated with a shipment. Where logistics 
provider emissions data isn’t available, we use weight 
and distance data by shipment collected from the 
providers to estimate WTW emissions, using emissions 
factors from the 2019 Global Logistics Emissions Council 
(GLEC) framework. Where logistics provider data isn’t 
available, emissions are estimated based on reported 
data from other transportation providers and the number 
of units shipped. For warehousing emissions, we collect 
energy data directly from the warehouses and estimate 
emissions using LCA electricity and fuel factors from 
the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Where 
warehouse energy data isn’t available, we estimate using 
the 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption 
Survey (CBECS) data and the warehouse square footage 
allocated to Alphabet.
Category 6: “Business travel” includes emissions from 
air, rail, and car rental travel. Distance and fuel-based 
travel data is collected through our online booking system 
or through a third-party travel agency for all sources. 
Data obtained from our value chain partners isn’t used at 
this time. Emissions are calculated using 2022 DEFRA U.K. 
Government GHG Conversion Factors for air travel, the 
2017 WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Emission Factors from 
Cross Sector Tools for rail travel, and the 2023 EPA Center 
for Corporate Climate Leadership GHG Emission Factors 
Hub for car rental travel. 
Category 7: “Employee commuting, including 
teleworking” includes emissions from the transport of 
our full-time employees between their homes and their worksites by private vehicle, public transit, motorcycle, 
and gas-powered scooter commuting trips. To determine 
the number of commuting trips by mode made in 2022, we 
surveyed our employees to determine typical commuting 
patterns and applied these commuting patterns to our 
global employee population. The calculation uses an 
average commuting distance for passenger vehicles 
obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 
2017 National Household Travel Survey and an average fuel 
efficiency for passenger vehicles obtained from the U.S. 
Department of Transportation’s Transportation Statistics 
Table 4–23. Data obtained from our value chain partners 
isn’t used at this time. Emissions are calculated using 
2022 DEFRA U.K. Government GHG Conversion Factors 
for passenger vehicles. This category also includes 
teleworking emissions, which we began to estimate and 
report in 2020, when teleworking became prevalent due 
to the global pandemic. Teleworking represents emissions 
generated by employees working remotely from their 
homes. We apply the estimation methodology outlined in 
EcoAct’s 2020 Homeworking Emissions white paper to our 
annual average workforce in 2022.
Category 11: “Use of sold products” includes emissions 
generated by all of Google’s flagship consumer hardware 
products sold in 2022. Flagship consumer hardware 
products are products that can provide their main 
functionality without connection to another product. For 
example, this doesn’t include accessories, such as cases. 
Use impact was calculated using laboratory power draw 
measurements, data on use patterns, common industry 
assumptions on product lifetimes, and LCA electricity 
emission factors from the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts 
database. In our Environmental data tables , emissions 
from use of sold products are presented in “Other 
categories.”Category 12: “End-of-life treatment of sold products” 
includes GHG emissions associated with the end-of-life 
treatment of all of Google’s flagship consumer hardware 
products sold in 2022. End-of-life impact was calculated 
through our LCA process using emission factors from 
the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Our initial 
assessments identify this category to be one that doesn’t 
have significant life-cycle impact. We continue to develop 
programs to extend the life of our sold products and also 
to ensure efficient management of end-of-life materials. 
In our Environmental data tables , emissions from end-of-
life treatment of sold products are presented in “Other 
categories.”
In 2022, we revised our methodology to calculate 
emissions related to our consumer hardware 
manufacturing, as we updated from a spend-based 
methodology to a Life Cycle Assessment-based 
methodology. We also made improvements to the quality 
of data used in estimating our emissions associated 
with manufacturing our data center hardware, as well 
as the LCAs and LCA emission factors used to calculate 
emissions related to data center construction. We didn’t 
recalculate prior year Scope 3 GHG emissions to reflect 
these changes.
Biogenic emissions
In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 
biogenic emissions are reported separately from 
other Scope 1 GHG emissions. These CO2 emissions 
are generated from our operated vehicles consuming 
biofuels. Biogenic emissions are calculated using emission 
factors from the 2023 EPA Center for Corporate Climate 
Leadership GHG Emission Factors Hub.Emissions reductions and 
compensations
We calculate our total operational emissions by summing 
Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), Scope 3 (Category 
6: Business travel), and Scope 3 (Category 7: Employee 
commuting, including teleworking), per the criteria 
described above. This market-based subtotal has been 
reduced by the impact of renewable energy procurement 
via PPAs and market-based emission factors. 
Our operational emissions are then further compensated 
for by high-quality carbon credits enabled through 
contracted carbon offset projects, which capture and 
destroy highly potent GHGs. A carbon offset project is 
an activity that reduces GHG emissions or captures GHG 
emissions from the atmosphere, ultimately represented 
by a carbon credit. The carbon credit signifies that 
GHG emissions are lower than if no one had invested 
in the project. One carbon credit equals one metric ton 
of carbon dioxide equivalent prevented from entering 
the atmosphere. We assess these projects against 
four standards before investing: additionality, leakage 
prevention, permanence, and verifiability. 
We primarily enter into long-term purchase agreements 
with carbon credit suppliers to secure future deliveries. 
Once carbon credits from a project under contract 
are verified by a third-party and issued by a carbon 
registry, per the agreement terms, ownership of the 
carbon credits is transferred from the project owner to 
Google. Our carbon credits are verified under the Climate 
Action Reserve (CAR), American Carbon Registry (ACR), 
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), or the UNFCCC Clean 
Development Mechanism.   89
2023 Environmental Report  All carbon credits are retired on a public registry after 
they’re delivered to us. Due to the timing of third-party 
verifications, delivery and retirement for some 2022 
carbon credits occurs after the year ended December 
31, 2022. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol states that a 
GHG target can be met through using credits that are 
generated from GHG reduction projects at sources 
external to the (company’s) boundary. They’re designed 
to be interchangeable globally and deliverable from a 
variety of project types. Refer to our Google’s Carbon 
Offsets: Collaboration and Due Diligence white paper 
for additional information. The quantity of carbon credits 
enabled through contracted projects is subject to the 
limited assurance procedures noted above; however, the 
quality of our projects and the related due diligence isn’t 
subject to the limited assurance procedures.
Other carbon and 
energy metrics
Our carbon intensity metrics  are calculated as defined 
by GRI Disclosure 305-4a-c. Carbon intensity metrics are 
based on gross global combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 
(market-based) emissions. Reported carbon intensity per 
unit of revenue and per full-time equivalent (FTE) employee 
values are rounded to the nearest hundredth, and reported 
carbon intensity per MWh of energy consumed values are 
rounded to the nearest ten thousandth.
Total energy consumption  is calculated as defined 
by GRI Disclosure 302-1e-f. Total energy consumption 
includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased 
electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity 
generated on-site from renewable sources. Total 
electricity consumption is calculated as defined by GRI Disclosure 302-1c(i) and 302-1f, and includes both 
purchased and self-generated electricity. Where actual 
electricity consumption for facilities isn’t available, we 
estimate consumption using company square footage and 
internally developed electricity intensity factors based on 
fiscal year 2022 data.
Electricity purchased from renewable sources (%) is 
calculated on a calendar-year basis, dividing the volume 
of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for 
our global operations (i.e., renewable energy procured 
through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy 
generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids 
where our facilities are located) by the total volume of 
electricity consumed by our global operations. This metric 
includes all renewable energy purchased, regardless of 
the market in which the renewable energy was consumed.
Google currently purchases enough renewable energy  
to match our annual global electricity consumption.  
To achieve our 100% renewable energy match  goal, 
we first consider both our on-site renewable energy 
generation and the renewable energy that’s already in the 
electric grids where our facilities are located, then procure 
renewable energy through PPA agreements and utility 
renewable energy tariffs. We have a few facilities located 
in geographies where we’re not currently able to source 
large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently 
make up for this by buying surplus renewable energy 
in regions where it’s abundant. For example, by buying 
larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we 
compensate for our lack of renewable energy purchases 
in Asia. This approach results in our Scope 2 market-based 
emissions being greater than zero, per the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, despite us achieving our 
100% renewable energy match globally.Water metrics
We report all water metrics for Alphabet Inc. and its 
subsidiaries’ data centers, offices, and other assets under 
our operational control. “Water consumption”  is equal 
to (“Water withdrawal” – “Water discharge”). Our 
reported water consumption, water withdrawal, and water 
discharge metrics don’t include seawater. Water metrics 
are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand gallons and 
are reported in million gallons. 
Water withdrawal data is based on actual metered 
or invoiced data when it’s available. At offices where 
metered or invoiced data isn’t available, water withdrawal 
is estimated using facility square footage and internally 
developed water withdrawal intensity factors by office 
type based on fiscal year data. In all instances where 
actual potable water discharge isn’t available, we apply a 
90% discharge flow factor to the facility water withdrawal 
to estimate water discharge. For irrigation water, we apply 
a 0% discharge flow factor to the facility water withdrawal 
to estimate water discharge. This estimation process is 
applicable to all offices and to potable and irrigation water 
withdrawal at data centers used for domestic purposes 
(i.e., water not used for IT cooling) where actual discharge 
isn’t available.Forward-looking

2023 Environmental Report  Environmental reporting frameworks index
To determine what content to include in this report,  
we considered global sustainability reporting frameworks and guidelines, industry best practices, and stakeholder expectations. 
We maintain an ESG Index  which maps our public 
disclosures to the Sustainable Accounting Standards 
Board  (SASB ) and to the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures  (TCFD ) frameworks. We’ve formally 
expressed support  for the TCFD reporting framework and its seven principles for climate disclosure, and we believe that our voluntary disclosures on climate-related matters are consistent with the recommendations of the TCFD framework. 
Every year since 2009, we’ve publicly reported our 
carbon footprint to CDP  (formerly known as the 
Carbon Disclosure Project). Since 2014, Alphabet has been included on CDP’s Climate Change A-list eight times, demonstrating our continued commitment to transparency and climate reporting. For our most recent CDP Climate Change Response, see our sustainability reports  page. 
Climate transition plan
In this report, we’ve outlined elements of our climate transition plan that will help us make progress toward our net-zero ambitions. This includes information about our GHG emissions, science-based emissions reduction target, emissions reduction initiatives, low-carbon products and services, value chain engagement, policy advocacy and engagement, climate risk assessment, and governance mechanisms. 
To see where elements of our climate transition plan 
can be found, see report locations marked with (

2023 Environmental Report  Endnotes
1 Throughout this report, we use the term “sustainability” to refer to 
environmental sustainability.
2 Our partners include governments and intergovernmental organizations; 
customers and commercial partners; and researchers, academics, and 
non-governmental organizations.
3 Google uses a high-quality ML prediction model to estimate the expected 
fuel or energy consumption for each route option when users request 
driving directions. We identify the route that we predict will consume the 
least amount of fuel or energy. If this route isn’t already the fastest one and 
it offers meaningful energy and fuel savings with only a small increase in 
driving time, we recommend it to the user. To calculate enabled emissions 
reductions, we tally the fuel usage from the chosen fuel-efficient routes 
and subtract it from the predicted fuel consumption that would have 
occurred on the fastest route without eco-friendly routing and apply 
adjustments for factors such as: CO2e factors, fleet factors, well-to-wheels 
factors, and powertrain mismatch factors. We then input the estimated 
prevented emissions into the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies 
Calculator  to calculate equivalent cars off the road for a year. The 2022 
figure covers estimated emissions prevented after eco-friendly routing was 
launched, from October 2021 through December 2022. Enabled emissions 
reductions estimates include inherent uncertainty due to factors that 
include the lack of primary data and precise information about real-world 
actions and their effects. These factors contribute to a range of possible 
outcomes, within which we report a central value.
4 This estimated spend is based on contracts signed to purchase clean 
energy for our operations. Actual spend may vary from these estimates 
based on changes in renewable electricity output from operational 
projects, the number of contracts signed, and energy market prices.
5 See endnote 3 above.
6 Estimated energy savings are calculated based on the typical percentage 
of heating and cooling savings found in real-world studies of the Nest 
Learning Thermostat. To calculate the total Nest savings, we apply these 
savings percentages to the actual heating and cooling hours of all Nest 
thermostats.
7 “Portugal - Countries &amp; Regions ,” IEA, 2021. 
8 The enabled emissions reductions are calculated based on these energy 
savings, applying standard emission factors for fossil fuels, and using U.S. 
EPA AVERT marginal emissions for the 95% of electricity savings that occur 
in the U.S., with an adjusted value for the 5% of electricity savings outside 
the U.S.
9 For products launched in 2022: Pixel, Nest, and Chromecast devices are 
made with recycled materials ranging between 9% and 60% based on 
respective product weights.
10 Unique, signed-in Google users that were provided information to make a 
more sustainable choice by at least one sustainable product feature.
11 Due to a methodology change, we’re not reporting a percent progress 
towards this target and have instead provided our total GHG emissions 
(Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3) in 2022.
12 In 2022, we expanded our carbon-free energy reporting from only 
Google-owned and -operated data centers to also incorporate offices and third-party data centers. The 2022 data center CFE number represents a 
2% change from 2021 (66% CFE), as a result of including third-party data 
centers.

infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry 
averages.

76 PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-
computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to power IT equipment. A PUE of 
2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed 
to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means 
nearly all the energy is used for computing.
77 According to the Uptime Institute’s 2022 Global Data Center Survey , the 
global average PUE of respondents’ data centers was around 1.55.
78 See endnote 19 above.
79 Trailing 12-month PUE consists of the average PUE for the previous 12 
months.
80 Data from reported ports for ChargePoint stations in the United States and 
Canada only are used to estimate emissions prevented from employee EV 
commuting.
81 Based on data collected from shuttle commuting trips in the Bay Area, 
as compared to a scenario in which these employees had each used a 
private, fuel-based car for commuting. Assumptions include average 
Googler commute distance, miles per gallon assumptions from the Bureau 
of Transportation, and emissions per gallon of fuel assumptions from the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Equivalency estimate is based on workdays in 
the year, using data from “ Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator ,” U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, accessed 2022.
82 See endnote 81 above.
83 Carbon-free energy is any type of electricity generation that doesn’t 
directly emit carbon dioxide, including (but not limited to) solar, wind, 
geothermal, hydropower, and nuclear. Sustainable biomass and carbon 
capture and storage (CCS) are special cases considered on a case-by-case 
basis, but are often also considered carbon-free energy sources.
84 Alphabet’s renewable energy methodology is a custom calculation and is 
based on a global approach. Percentage of renewable energy is calculated 
on a calendar-year basis, dividing the volume of renewable electricity 
(in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations (i.e., renewable 
energy procured through our PPA contracts, on-site renewable energy 
generation, and renewable energy in the electric grids where our facilities 
are located) by the total volume of electricity consumed by our global 
operations. The numerator includes all renewable energy procured, 
regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. 
Additional details on Alphabet’s criteria and methodology can be found in  
the “ Achieving Our 100% Renewable Energy Purchasing Goal and Going 
Beyond ” disclosure.
85 For example, research by Princeton University  and TU Berlin has shown that 
hourly (24/7) carbon-free energy goals have a greater impact on grid-level 
decarbonization than the prevailing approach of 100% annual renewable 
energy matching.
86 See endnote 4 above.
87 See endnote 4 above.
88 “Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator ,” EPA, accessed 2022.
89 Our CFE percentage measures the degree to which our electricity 
consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly 
basis. This is calculated using both CFE under contract by Google as well 
as CFE coming from the overall grid mix. CFE coming from the overall grid 
mix is based on data obtained from a third party, Electricity Maps, and has 
not been assured. For more information, see our 2021 white paper, “ 24/7 
Carbon-Free Energy: Methodologies and Metrics .”
90 A grid region (or regional grid) corresponds to the area over which a 
single entity manages the operation of the electric power system and 
ensures that demand and supply are finely balanced. In the United States, 
this generally means the ISO or RTO in regions that have these regional    102
2023 Environmental Report  market structures. If no such structure exists, then Google defines the grid 
region as the electricity-balancing authority where our data centers are 
located. Outside of the United States, the grid region most often refers to 
the geographic boundary of a country, because most grid system operators 
operate at the national level. Certain regions that span multiple countries 
are well interconnected and could be considered as one grid; however, 
our grid mix calculations already include import and export considerations 
and therefore take into account power flows from neighboring grids. In 
the future, we may update our definition as we work with grid operators to 
better understand how transmission constraints or congestion impact CFE 
measurement within and across grid regions.
91 Contracted CFE is the hourly electricity production from clean energy 
projects whose electricity and associated environmental attributes are 
contracted to Google via power purchase agreements, retail energy supply 
arrangements, or other contractual structures. See “ 24/7 Carbon-Free 
Energy: Methodologies and Metrics ” for more details.

146 All reported Scope 1 GHG emissions, Scope 2 GHG emissions, and 
biogenic emissions values are rounded to the nearest hundred. All 
reported Scope 3 emissions values are rounded to the nearest thousand.
147 In 2022, we included estimates for hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions 
resulting from the leakage of refrigerants from cooling equipment at our 
offices and data centers in our Scope 1 emissions. We have not updated 
prior years to include estimated refrigerant emissions.
148 Our Scope 2 market-based emissions increased 37%, primarily due to 
increased data center electricity consumption and a lack of full regional 
coverage of renewable energy procurement in the United States and Asia 
Pacific regions.
149 Certain Category 1: “Purchased goods and services” emissions are 
presented in Category 2: “Capital goods.” See the Methodology  section 
for more details.
150 In 2022, we updated our Scope 3 Category 7: “Employee commuting” 
methodology to estimate additional modes of transportation due to the 
availability of new data sources. See the Methodology  section for more 
details.
151 We present certain Scope 3 emissions from Category 1, Category 2, 
Category 11, and Category 12 as an aggregated subtotal “Other categories” 
for business reasons, as described further in the Methodology  section.
152 Other GHGs, including perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), 
and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), are not included in our inventory, as they’re not emitted as a result of our operations.
153 “Total renewable energy allocated” includes the total amount of renewable 
electricity generation conveyed via contractual instruments, which have 
been used in the calculation of Scope 2 market-based emissions per the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Quality Criteria.
154 Reported energy values (in MW or MWh) are rounded to the nearest 100.
155 “Purchased electricity” is electricity sourced from an electrical grid and 
purchased from a local electric utility company. This metric differs slightly 
from “Total electricity consumption,” which includes both purchased and 
self-generated electricity.
156 See endnote 155 above.
157 See the Methodology  section for an overview of our “percentage of 
electricity procured from renewable sources” calculation.
158 We report individual campus PUE only for campuses with at least twelve 
months of data. All reported PUE values are rounded to the hundredths place.
159 See endnote 76 above.
160 See endnote 89 above.
161 See endnote 12 above.
162 See endnote 90 above.
163 See endnote 90 above.
164 Reported waste generated values are rounded to the nearest hundred.
165 Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable 
pathway than landfill, as a percentage of total waste. Starting in 2022, we’ve 
updated our landfill diversion rate methodology for our office operations by 
removing contamination from our recycling and compost streams, providing 
a more accurate representation of landfill avoidance, and supporting our 
efforts to maintain high-quality diverted materials.
166 We expanded this data center hardware refurbishment key performance 
indicator from including only decommissioned parts that were reused for 
server maintenance to also including other refurbished part types reused for 
server maintenance as well as server deployment and upgrades. This change 
more accurately reflects Google’s approach to data center material reuse.
167 All reported water values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand 
gallons and reported in million gallons.
168 In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose 
three water indicators: total water withdrawal, consumption, and discharge. 
Data for total water consumption and total water discharge is not available 
for prior years. Our reported water metrics don’t include seawater.
169 We contracted a third party to quantify volumetric benefits by applying 
industry standard methodologies and defensible data and assumptions.  
See the Benefiting watersheds and communities  section for more details.
170 Our reported water metrics don’t include seawater. All reported water 
values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand gallons and reported in 
million gallons.
